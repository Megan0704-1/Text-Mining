0,3/16/2022,Threat to a free Press,"Never has the free Press and media been more important than at this pivotal moment in European history. With Vladimir Putin throwing up a smokescreen of fake news to mask his barbaric war on Ukraine, Western journalists risk life and limb daily to tell the real story. Their heroics remind us that freedom of expression is not a given. It must be cherished and fought for. Even here in Britain the free Press is under threat. The revised Online Safety Bill due to be published on Thursday is designed to make social media firms responsible for tackling illegal content and protecting children from online harms. But for all its undoubted good intentions, it contains a highly dangerous flaw. Algorithms used by tech giants to remove harmful material could also block the online output of bona fide news organisations. For example, legitimate stories about terrorism or child abuse could be blocked by default – with crushing effect on press freedom.', ""Thankfully Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries recognises the problem and says she has 'every intention of further improving the requirements for platforms not to remove content from recognised media outlets'."", 'This welcome acknowledgement must be followed by detailed proposals to amend the Bill. In an ideal world, legitimate online news outlets would be taken out of it altogether. Failing that, they must be fully protected against unintended censorship.', ""We simply can't allow algorithms dreamed up in Silicon Valley to dictate what the British public should, and should not, be allowed to know.""","Vladimir Putin, Nadine, Bill",daily_mail
1,4/5/2022,Stiffer sanctions can help stop slaughter,"Not since the slaughter of thousands of men and boys at Srebrenica a quarter of a century ago has Europe seen atrocities on the scale of those orchestrated by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.', ""The unspeakable savagery meted out against civilians by the Russian army, as it retreats tail between legs from near Kyiv, is testament to the dictator's depravity."", 'Even as the Kremlin snivels that it is the victim of misinformation and faked images, more evidence emerges of its war crimes. A mayor executed and dumped in a pit alongside her husband and son. A woman raped and murdered, her body desecrated with a swastika. More torture, more mutilation, more mass graves. And these horrors are undoubtedly only the tip of the iceberg. The world has reacted with revulsion. Rightly, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden have called for Putin to face justice. But, for now, that puts the cart in front of the horse. There is no chance of the monster facing war crime charges unless Ukraine wins the conflict. For that to happen, Russia must be weakened further. That means giving President Zelensky the weapons he needs. And it means ratcheting up economic sanctions to the crippling maximum.', ""Above all, Europe should ban imports of Putin's oil and gas. Yes, it will come at a cost, but those revenues fund his war machine and ultimately kill innocent Ukrainians."", 'Germany is resisting but it must be persuaded to back down. The West, which Putin had dismissed as decadent and disunited, has showed admirable common purpose in facing down evil. For the sake of Ukraine, democracy and freedom, it must continue to do so.', ""The war has exposed just what a dog's dinner successive governments have made of our domestic energy policy."", 'Blindly buying into green dogma has left us at the mercy of unreliable renewables and foreign regimes to provide fuel for heating, industry and motoring.', ""Downing Street's imminent energy strategy is a chance to put us firmly on a sensible path to self-sufficiency."", 'So the commitment to develop new North Sea oil and gas fields is long overdue, as is reconsidering fracking, which has been regulated into irrelevance. Whatever they decide, ministers must stick to their guns. Deliberation and dawdling landed us in this mire in the first place. Since foreign travel was effectively banned, no industry was hit harder during the pandemic than the airlines. But with restrictions lifted and families desperate for sunshine breaks, Easter was a perfect chance to claw back lost billions.', ""Unfortunately, they've botched it horribly. Foreseeable staff shortages forced carriers to cancel flights, leaving holidaymakers fuming in departure lounges. Some operators have jacked up prices to apparently deter customers – a curious business model!"", ""The airline industry is supposed to be a jewel in our national crown. At present, it's a national embarrassment."", 'In a blast of refreshing common sense, the equalities watchdog says organisations such as gyms, hospitals and refuges can legally restrict services to a single sex.', ""This is a huge victory for women's rights, which trans activists have sought to erode by browbeating public bodies and firms."", 'New guidance should set a precedent for how to deal with this thorny issue. Of course, transgender people deserve respect. But an obsession with inclusivity at all costs cannot ride roughshod over the privacy and safety of half the population.","Boris Johnson, Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden, Putin, Easter, Zelensky",daily_mail
2,4/8/2022,Stop ticking boxes and give Ukrainian refugees sanctuary,"""The depredations and sheer inhumanity of Vladimir Putin's marauding army in Ukraine grow worse by the day. The latest stories are almost too appalling to take in."", 'More than 50 killed and dozens wounded, including children, after a brutal Russian rocket strike on a Donbas railway station packed with fleeing refugees. A pregnant teenager and 78-year-old grandmother raped, with others allegedly tortured to death in Kherson. In Chernihiv, more than 300 civilians locked in a cramped, decrepit school basement for a month.', ""They weren't allowed to leave, even to use the toilet, and at least 12 died from suffocation."", ""It's the sort of cruelty one might expect from Islamic State. Not a country that pretends to belong to the civilised world."", 'Yet as desperate Ukrainian families cry out to escape this place of torment and death, pettifogging bureaucrats in this country conspire to deny them sanctuary. More than 200,000 Britons have offered to share their homes and 80,000 refugees have gratefully applied to come here. But because of the brainless tick-box culture among council inspectors, many residences have been rejected on health and safety grounds.', ""Some of the reasons are truly risible. Stairs deemed 'too steep'. Loose floorboards. A step up into the bathroom. Lack of guard rails."", ""Risk assessments must be made, of course – on properties and prospective hosts. But where's the sense of proportion?"", 'A mother and her children who have cowered for weeks in a bombed-out basement in Mariupol are hardly likely to worry about the floorboards in a house in Tunbridge Wells or Tadcaster.', ""The application process is also too complex and protracted. Despite promises to simplify it there's still a backlog of nearly 40,000 cases."", 'We are in the midst of a humanitarian nightmare. Every day of quibbling and prevarication is a day wasted. And it compounds the trauma of these innocent casualties of war. More than just a smear', ""Controversy over the Sunak family's financial affairs deepened yesterday with the extraordinary revelation that the Chancellor held an American 'green card' and filed US tax returns for a full 18 months after taking the reins at the UK Treasury."", 'Quite apart from the troubling question of whether he therefore avoided paying tax in this country on US earnings (he owns property there), green card holders are meant to be permanent residents in America. Difficult for a government minister, one might think. Coming after the news that his wealthy Indian wife Akshata Murty enjoyed non-domicile tax status in Britain, this has become a full-blown crisis for Mr Sunak.', ""He condemns the attacks on his wife as 'a smear'. She pays full UK tax on all income in this country, he says, and anyway, 'she is not her husband's possession'."", ""No, but she's the wife of the Chancellor, so must expect her finances to be scrutinised, especially as her husband has just imposed swingeing new taxes on the British people, which she presumably won't pay."", 'She implies that, as an Indian citizen, she had no option but to become a non-dom. That is not true. It was her choice.', ""And the problem with the Chancellor's wife not paying UK tax, is that it looks like one rule for his family and one for the rest of us."", 'This is more than just a smear. There are pressing and legitimate questions to answer. How much tax has she avoided?', ""Will she pay it back? What other tax shelters does she use? And that's before we even start on the green card mystery."", 'He may think the questions unfair. But until Mr Sunak answers them fully and frankly, the whiff of hypocrisy and double standards will not go away.",Vladimir Putins,daily_mail
3,4/19/2022,Bone-idle bureaucrats must get off their sofas,"If Britain is to bounce back fully from the pandemic, the entire workforce must pull in the same direction. But while millions put the economy first by returning to offices, factories and shops, the Mail revealed on Saturday that Whitehall still resembles a ghost town. Sir Humphrey is letting handsomely paid civil servants continue working from home. Today, we reveal the extent of this scandal. While war rages in Ukraine, only one in three Foreign Office staff are back at their desks. The same goes for the Business Department, even as households and firms struggle with crippling energy bills. Most departments are not even half full. So three cheers to Efficiency Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg for zapping this stifling indolence. He has told the Cabinet to make bone-idle bureaucrats change out of their jogging bottoms and return to work rapidly.', ""Senior mandarins harrumph that staff can perform effectively from home. But anyone banging their head against a brick wall trying to renew a passport or driving licence knows that's hogwash."", 'The awkward pantomime of a video conference call is no substitute for the real thing. This can be bad for morale and career development, especially for the young, who are starved of the support of their peers and senior colleagues. As well as fuelling creativity and productivity, office working throws a lifeline to small firms that rely on passing trade.', ""The civil service supposedly runs the country. What example does it set when staff won't drag themselves off their sofas?"", 'Axe this party palaver', ""Proving those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, Nicola Sturgeon has been admonished by police for breaking her own lockdown rules."", 'The high priestess of Covid crackdowns admitted not wearing a mask while electioneering at a barber shop. Mistakes happen. Still, it is deeply humiliating. The SNP leader has been chief tut-tutter at the public, shaming them to obey her overbearing restrictions – and just days ago hypocritically insisted that Boris Johnson resign for receiving a fine.', ""Let's hope the Metropolitan Police take note, quit dragging their feet over Partygate and ditch their overzealous enforcement."", 'As ill-advised as the soirees might have been, they involved people working closely together to tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic. With Parliament sitting again after Easter, Labour will grandstand by seeking to censure the Prime Minister over his fine, a vote it will undoubtedly lose. After that, the Government needs to focus on the Ukraine war, rebuilding the Covid-ravaged economy and living costs. A line must be drawn under this sorry saga. At last, clerical clarity From the ill-informed virtue-signalling on migrants by Justin Welby to a cleric who does speak for the flock he represents. The Bishop of Odessa has hailed Mail readers for helping fund life-saving food parcels for starving families in Ukraine. Despite the cost of living squeeze, you have responded to our refugee campaign with unmatched benevolence. Those famished victims know they are not alone.', ""Meanwhile, thanks to flak jackets and helmets donated by this paper, Ukrainian journalists can keep exposing the atrocities committed by Putin's army – further damning the dictator in the world's eyes.""","Whitehall, Boris Johnson, Justin Welby, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Humphrey, Mail, tut-tutter, Putin, Nicola Sturgeon",daily_mail
4,4/22/2022,Mail readers' weapon against Putin's cruelty,"In the dark nightmare of warfare, munitions are not the only weapons. To terrorise populations (and in flagrant breach of all conventions) rogue armies rape and murder civilians.', ""Then there is starvation. Throughout history, repugnant regimes have sought to break enemies' will by deliberately pushing their people into famine."", 'Today, in supposedly civilised Europe, evil Vladimir Putin is inflicting such hell on innocent Ukrainians. Russian invaders have intentionally destroyed farms, grain silos and supermarkets and, in a key city in Luhansk, obliterated food depots. The consequences of this war crime are as tragic as they are predictable. Ukrainians have been reduced to scrabbling in bins and collecting drinking water from puddles. Amid such distress, you – our magnificent readers – are offering a lifeline. Thanks to your magnificent generosity, hundreds of thousands of life-saving food boxes are being sent to Ukraine. Given the worsening crisis, these vital aid parcels could not be more timely.', ""The record-breaking £11million you've raised for the Mail Force refugee appeal shows the victims they are not forgotten."", ""Is Putin, as Ukrainians fear, trying to recreate the Holodomor – the 'hunger extermination', when Stalin starved millions of their countrymen to death?"", 'Who knows. But your kind donations are a powerful weapon in the fight to stop history repeating itself. Put customers first', ""On its website, Santander boasts of offering 'a more personal banking service whenever you need it'."", ""Mike Regnier, the bank's extravagantly paid boss, should explain that to customers who will be severely inconvenienced by his branches slashing their opening hours."", 'Wheeling out the old excuse, the lender argues this is because most customers want to bank online or by telephone.', ""But isn't it a case of chicken and egg? Reducing counter services makes it more difficult for someone to go to a branch."", 'That forces many to turn to internet banking, which executives then cynically use as an excuse to cut more hours – or shut branches entirely. As usual, the biggest losers are the elderly and vulnerable. With cyber-scammers a threat, they prefer to rely on cash and deal with real people. And small firms, forced to shut up shop at the busiest time of the day to deposit money, suffer too. Yes, as a commercial operation, Santander must pay attention to the bottom line. But is it too much to ask that, for once, they put profits second – and customers first? Lessons never learnt They died 27 years apart. Both defenceless little children, both murdered with unspeakable brutality. But their violent deaths are not the only connection between Logan Mwangi, five, and Rikki Neave, six. They were failed abysmally by institutions whose job it was to protect them and deliver justice.', ""Social services missed a string of red flags that Logan was being tortured. Police blunders meant Rikki's killer was at large for years – free to commit other depravities."", ""Every time one of these appalling scandals occurs, we are told 'lessons will be learned', that official incompetence, box-ticking and blame-shifting will be stamped out. How shameful that they never are.""","Rikki Neave, Logan Mwangi, Vladimir Putin, Logan, Stalin, Putin, Mike Regnier",daily_mail
5,2/23/2022,Nato must not fold in face of Putin's tyranny,"""It's no exaggeration to say that decisions taken in Europe over the next few days will define world security for a generation. As Russian tanks roll in to Ukraine, will the Nato alliance stand or will it fold?"", ""If it folds, Vladimir Putin's audacious land grab will not stop at eastern Ukraine. Like all bullies, he will want more. Kiev would surely be his next target. Then how long before his predatory eye fell on the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania?"", ""The president has clearly absorbed Lenin's famous parable: Probe the enemy with your bayonet. If you find mush, you push. If you find steel, you withdraw."", ""Until yesterday the West's response had been more mush than steel. Germany, hungry for Russian gas, had been scandalously muted in defending Ukraine."", 'Worse still, French President Emmanuel Macron, pathetically desperate to be seen as a global player, sucked up to Putin – who played him like a cheap violin. While he was supposedly brokering a diplomatic deal between Moscow and Washington, the invasion began. It was nothing less than a ritual humiliation. But yesterday, the wheel appeared to be turning. Boris Johnson – who has handled the crisis with aplomb – laid out tough new sanctions designed to freeze Russia out of the global finance system. Germany, in a belated but welcome show of solidarity, put a block on Nord Stream 2 – the underwater pipeline due to carry Russian gas to Western Europe. America has sanctions against 735 individuals and entities – including trade embargoes, travel bans and freezing of assets – and last night announced more. Even the hapless EU has come to the party and punished Russia.', ""Now the phony war is over and Ukraine's sovereignty has been breached, the Western alliance is beginning to show some resolve – with instant effect."", ""Russian stocks, bond values and the rouble are tumbling. If Putin's oil and gas exports are also restricted, the Russian economy will take a grievous hit."", 'If liberal democracy is to triumph over totalitarianism, the pressure must be kept up and, if necessary, intensified. Only by standing together can the West show that tyranny will not prevail.', ""Football's own goal"", ""While the people of Ukraine brace themselves for Putin's onslaught, it's business as usual for the ethically bankrupt sport of football."", 'Never shy of taking dodgy cash, Uefa refuses to relocate its showcase Champions League final from St Petersburg. But then their main sponsor is the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Meanwhile, Manchester United – who play in the tournament tonight – are heavily funded by Russian national airline Aeroflot. In the grasping world of football, the contest between money and morals only ever has one winner.","Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Vladimir Putins, Kiev, Gazprom, Putin, Lenin, Manchester United",daily_mail
6,2/24/2022,Woke and dagger only boosts UK's enemies,"""It can be credibly argued that Britain's security services have never faced a more serious array of threats than they do today."", 'Europe teetering on the brink of war as Russian tanks rumble into Ukraine. China menacingly flexing its muscles. Hostile regimes relentlessly engaged in espionage and cyber warfare. And terrorists planning atrocities on our streets. No wonder the head of MI5 grimly told the Mail that our entire way of life is in peril. Terrifyingly, not all our spymasters have a laser-like focus on defending the country.', ""While our enemies plot, national security adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove is obsessed with Britain's undercover agents raising their game on inclusivity and diversity."", ""This preposterous mandarin wants spies educated in dubious academic ideologies such as 'white privilege', while declaring their gender pronouns."", ""Equally bizarre, he says words such as 'strong' and 'grip' should be avoided, claiming they reinforce masculine stereotypes. Leave aside that such a view is profoundly chauvinistic itself (can a woman not be 'strong' or have 'grip'?)."", 'It is insane that at a time of grave international danger, with UK interests and lives at risk, some of our security chiefs are fixated on garbled wokery. Such indulgent introspection only weakens Britain – and strengthens our enemies. Lessons in hypocrisy Has Boris Johnson pulled his punches by failing to impose the harshest sanctions against Russia over Ukraine?', ""Sir Keir Starmer is firm in his opinion: By targeting only five banks and three of Vladimir Putin's oligarch cronies, the Prime Minister has been scandalously timid."", ""Only tougher measures will rein in the tyrant, says Labour's leader."", 'Of course, his strategy has a glaring flaw. If there are no sanctions left in the locker, Putin has no incentive to halt his invasion until the Russian flag flies over Kiev.', ""But let's not take lessons from Sir Keir. Lest we forget, he battled to get Kremlin apologist Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. In that horrific scenario, who would've bet against Britain sending weapons to Moscow!"", 'Tellingly, he refuses to withdraw the whip from anti-Western Labour MPs who openly blame Nato, not Putin, for the aggression. Just as bad, he hypocritically berated Mr Johnson for failing to take TV station Russia Today, the Kremlin mouthpiece, off air. Yet David Lammy, his shadow foreign secretary, lined his pockets by appearing on its shows.', ""Before piously condemning the PM over sanctions, shouldn't Sir Keir first weed out the Putin sympathisers in his own party?"", 'The joyful old normal', ""Today, after two nightmarish years, the nation joyfully waves good riddance to the loathed 'new normal' of the pandemic."", 'With all legal restrictions axed – including self-isolation – we can re-embrace our old, cherished, pre-Covid lives. Even mask evangelist Sadiq Khan has lifted rules compelling travellers to wear face coverings on public transport (but only, we note, after he was photographed without one at a boxing match). Now the country can move on.

7,2/25/2022,The people of Ukraine are victims of a monstrous act of war,"Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the West has made a series of fatal assumptions. That liberal democracy had triumphed over totalitarianism. That the world had adopted our values of peace and individual freedom. That the bloody swords of yesteryear would be turned into ploughshares in a new globalised world of guaranteed growth and prosperity. And, above all, that the threat of a European war involving nuclear powers had been banished for good. Today, in the most shattering manner, we learn just how complacent and delusional those assumptions have been. While we have been busy congratulating ourselves and wasting energy in absurd cultural and commercial squabbles, tyranny has been relentlessly on the march. And while our commitment to maintaining a strong military capability has been half-hearted at best, our enemies are in deadly earnest. Vladimir Putin demonstrated just how deadly yesterday, as he launched Blitzkrieg on Ukraine by land, sea and air. Even though the drumbeat to war had in recent days become deafening, who among us was not shocked to wake up to terrifying headlines announcing the full-scale invasion?', ""And if that wasn't sufficiently chilling, the president's astonishing, rambling, warmongering rant certainly was."", ""Any country tempted to stand in Russia's way, he warned, faced retaliation that would 'lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history'."", 'Not since World War II has our continent seen a darker day. In this paper last Saturday, MI5 chief Ken McCallum warned we were in a historic struggle to defend our very way of life. How prescient he has proved to be. In this terrible act of aggression the echoes of history are unfolding before our eyes.', ""Until now, the West's response to this crisis has been utterly abject. Diplomacy has failed miserably."", 'The pantomime of Western presidents and chancellors rushing obligingly to Moscow in recent weeks to be humiliated by Putin one by one was deeply unedifying. Like a malevolent puppeteer, he blithely made them dance on their strings. With a straight face, he brazenly lied, strenuously denying he had plans to invade. How foolish he has made them all look — none more so than preening French leader Emmanuel Macron, who hubristically declared he had brokered a deal between Moscow and Washington, only to see it disintegrate within hours. By launching his attack, however, Putin has excommunicated himself from the international community of civilised nations, and Russia is now a pariah state.', ""The question on the world's lips now is: How far will this ruthless and vain megalomaniac go?"", ""Today, it's Ukraine that is paying the price of Western weakness. But Putin has grandiose territorial ambitions."", 'His stated dream is to reconstitute the Soviet Union. So where will he turn his guns tomorrow? The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? Georgia? Moldova? And if — or, more likely, when — he does, what will be our response? Does free Europe and the U.S. have the resolve to stop him in his tracks?', ""Putin is gambling that the answer is 'no'. And after Western forces not so much left Afghanistan as scarpered ignominiously for the exit, who can blame him?"", ""The truth is, it is little wonder the Kremlin shows such contempt for the West's threats. In the past, there has been such pathetically little substance to back them up."", 'In the past decade alone, Putin has annexed Crimea, shot down a civilian airliner, supported Syrian despot Assad and poisoned the Skripals in Salisbury. And what was his punishment for that litany of outrages? Embarrassingly feeble sanctions and a diplomatic slap on the wrist which had no discernible deterrent effect whatsoever. But perhaps, finally, a hard rain is going to fall. Boris Johnson captured the sombre, yet defiant, mood (and, dare we say, how far from the trivialities of Partygate — which sections of the nation lost its mind over — this now seems).', ""In Churchillian terms, he condemned Putin's 'hideous and barbaric venture', adding: 'He will never be able to cleanse the blood of Ukraine from his hands.'"", ""Significantly, he warned that Britain would act 'diplomatically, politically, economically and — eventually — militarily' to tame the dictator."", 'After all, there is no point arguing — as some inevitably will — that Ukraine is a long way away and events there are none of our business. For that is to ignore history.', ""Eighty-four years ago, with his hollow proclamation of 'peace for our time', Chamberlain emboldened Hitler by confirming that the Allies would never stand up to him."", ""Decisions taken now, in response to Russia's invasion, will determine whether 2022 goes down in history as a comparable year of shame."", ""It is time to match strident rhetoric with tough actions and hit the bloodstained bandit and his cronies in the most sensitive part of their anatomy — their wallets. On that score, this paper welcomes the Prime Minister's pledge to impose far tougher sanctions."", 'More than 100 firms and oligarchs will be barred from Britain. Mega-rich individuals will have bank deposits capped.', ""Putin's kleptocratic pals have a penchant for buying houses, shopping and sending their children to England's private schools."", ""But if Russia is determined to be Europe's enemy, we should treat them as such. We didn't allow the Nazi elite to educate their offspring or own property here during World War II."", ""Meanwhile, all major Russian banks will be kneecapped with an asset freeze and excluded from the UK financial system. And flights from Aeroflot — Russia's flag carrier — will be banned from landing on British soil."", ""This is a very useful start. It will tighten the squeeze on Russia's basket-case economy and make it more difficult for Putin to fund a prolonged military campaign. But what if the tyrant refuses to hold back from further violations of the international order?"", 'Mr Johnson wants to suspend Russia from the Swift international financial payment system, which would bring its economy to a shuddering halt. The U.S., which has taken a firm stand and unveiled harsher punishments, agrees. Yet, indefensibly, the move was blocked after an abject surrender by Germany and Italy, who selfishly fret it will damage their own banks. To successfully recreate a Tsarist empire, Putin must drive wedges between Western nations — weakening our collective unity. By cravenly putting the avoidance of short-term financial pain before standing up for democratic values, Berlin and Rome have done just that. It is truly contemptible.', ""This crisis has starkly exposed Europe's perilous dependence on Russian energy. It must end. This addiction is Putin's biggest financial and political trump card."", 'Without it, his power would crumble and his country would be beggared.', ""Of course, the war will deal a blow to Britain's economy. Higher petrol, energy and food prices will hit people's pockets — worsening the cost of living crisis. But for freedom's sake, we must be prepared to bear the pain — and do so for the long haul."", 'With luck, Mr Johnson gave Putin pause for thought — and stiffened the sinews of our partners — by vowing to use military force if a Nato nation is attacked. But we ask: how can Britain expect to be taken seriously when our Armed Forces have been cut, cut and cut again? Nevertheless, while the war in Ukraine is a catastrophe, for the West the situation could be indescribably worse. Had Sir Keir Starmer got his way at the 2019 election, Kremlin-sympathising, Nato-hating Jeremy Corbyn might now be in Downing Street.\xa0 In his fight against democracy, sovereignty and the right of people to choose their own destiny, Putin would have had an ally of unprecedented value.', ""Mercifully, thanks to the common sense and decency of the British electorate, he hasn't. Now it is imperative he fails in his warmongering. We must strain every fibre to ensure he does."", 'A final thought: conflict in Europe is frightening enough for Britons thousands of miles away. For the people of Ukraine, it is more than a hypothetical discussion: it is a terrifying reality, with shells falling, blood spilled, families torn apart, and lives ruined. As frightened masses flee their homes seeking safety, the continent must brace itself for a huge refugee crisis. The Ukrainian people are victims of a monstrous act of war.

Absurdly, the EU boasts that it – not Nato – is responsible for peace in Europe.', ""Now, that fig leaf lies exposed.

The Western alliance, which looked distinctly shaky in the early stages of this crisis, is now united in its resolve to punish him. Yesterday Britain, the US and EU despatched Putin and his contemptible regime to the financial, commercial and cultural equivalent of Siberia. They blocked all financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, finance ministry and national wealth fund, as well as individuals involved with those organisations. Even Switzerland, where tyrants have long salted away their ill-gotten gains in secret, is expected to join the punitive action.', ""This ratcheting up follows earlier sanctions on oligarchs, firms and financial institutions and Russia's expulsion from the Swift global banking system."", 'The combined result is hundreds of billions of pounds frozen and the rouble reduced to the status of junk currency. To stem roaring inflation, interest rates have shot up to 20 per cent. Sadly, ordinary Russians will be worst hit as the price of food and other essentials rockets.

Embarrassed and frustrated that his Plan A – a lightning military strike to install a puppet government in Kyiv – failed due to the valiant resistance of Ukrainian fighters, the tyrant has turned to a terrible Plan B.

Given the threat of further savagery, it is imperative the West ratchets up pressure on the Kremlin.

But we must also tighten the screw by imposing ever more punitive sanctions. Boris Johnson deserves plaudits for persuading allies to exile Russia, its banks and businesses from the global financial system. The result has been nothing short of crippling. Trade has collapsed, the rouble and Russian stocks have plummeted, and to tame rocketing inflation, interest rates have soared to 20 per cent. There are queues at banks as Russians try to withdraw cash and shops are running short on essential goods. There is consequently growing dissent towards Putin for dragging the country into a needless war.', ""Downing Street's commendable sanctions efforts, however, contain a stain: Its sluggish clampdown on Kremlin-linked oligarchs, where we lag far behind the EU."", 'Yes, two more tycoons were hit last night with travel bans and asset-freezes, which includes luxury UK properties.

14,3/7/2022,"In Russia's dystopia, the truth is a crime","In Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, the purpose of the Ministry of Truth was to rewrite history, by falsifying any facts which did not fit in with party doctrine. In a chilling case of life imitating art, Vladimir Putin is doing precisely that in Russia today.\xa0\xa0 There is no war in Ukraine, he says, and anyone who says there is will go to prison for up to 15 years. The Kremlin is trying furiously to shut down independent sources of news that show their leader to be a bare-faced liar.\xa0 But this is the age of the internet. The truth will out. The actual truth. There were anti-war demonstrations in 44 Russian cities yesterday, with more than 4,000 protesters herded into police vans.\xa0 They know what’s happening and so does everyone else. The idea that the population can be kept in the dark is simply risible. It’s easy to see Putin’s twisted logic.\xa0If there is no war, then it can’t be going badly.\xa0 But it is. Very badly. What was meant to be a stroll into Kyiv has become a deadly war of attrition. The heroic resistance of Ukrainian forces has caused such disarray among the invaders that Britain’s chief of the defence staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, believes Russia could even lose this campaign. Meanwhile, there is also dissent in Belarus – Russia’s staunchest ally. There are claims deputy defence minister Major General Viktor Gulevich has resigned, saying he couldn’t support the invasion and some Belarusian military personnel were refusing to engage in hostilities. General Gulevich is among those facing UK Government sanctions, suggesting that asset freezing and travel bans are already concentrating minds. Putin himself has described the sanctions regime as ‘an act of war’ and threatens reprisals – a sure sign that they are hurting him and his cronies. In a six-point plan to overcome Putin’s aggression and end the horror of war in Ukraine, Boris Johnson pledged to ratchet up sanctions further still. As we reveal today, more than 100 oligarchs, politicians and companies have been sanctioned by the US or EU but not yet by the UK.\xa0 Legal and bureaucratic hurdles are being cited as the reason. They must be cleared without further delay. Short of military action, sanctions are the West’s most potent weapon.\xa0 For Ukraine to have any chance of being saved from tyranny, they must be deployed at full speed – and with utter ruthlessness.', ""It's typical of Britain’s shambolic energy policy that in the midst of a global crisis we are about to block off the only avenue that could make us self-sufficient in gas."", 'Next week the country’s only two experimental shale gas wells – in Lancashire – are to be sealed with concrete, effectively abandoning this potentially vast domestic energy source. As well as supplying cheap gas, fracking could provide many thousands of jobs in the North of England, playing directly into the levelling-up agenda.\xa0 To dismiss it out of hand is simply crazy. We must start taking energy security seriously.\xa0 For all the wishing and hoping, renewables alone will not keep the lights and radiators on over the next 28 years. So in the Gadarene rush to net-zero, we will either have to buy in increasing supplies from despots such as Putin or turbocharge our own nuclear and North Sea production. The vaccine miracle showed what can be done by a public/private task force under dynamic leadership and liberated from the crushing red tape of Whitehall. Isn’t it time to mobilise a similar force to secure our energy needs for the next generation?\xa0 We must get our heads out of the sand.","Tony Radakin, Viktor Gulevich, Boris Johnson, Vladimir Putin, Gadarene, Gulevich, Putin",daily_mail

Arming Ukraine will drain the spirit of enemy soldiers.\xa0 And punishing sanctions are pushing Russia’s economy to the brink. Putin’s citizens may buy his words today.\xa0 But when inflation keeps soaring, supermarket shelves are empty and the middle classes find iPhones, Netflix and all the little luxuries they have come to expect unavailable, his popularity will tumble faster than the rouble. His country must remain an international pariah, held in revulsion until ordinary Russians rid the world of the monster. Meanwhile, as bombs rain down, the refugee crisis worsens. On this score Britain, which prides itself on its record of welcoming those fleeing war with open arms, has done pitifully little. How shameful that the Home Office makes exhausted, traumatised families negotiate a Byzantine bureaucratic system to reach safety, while anyone plucked from a small boat in the Channel is put up in a hotel at eye-watering cost.

Yet the Mail has been told that crucial safety technology, designed to close lanes to protect motorists marooned in high-speed traffic, was not working for days. This paper has already exposed lethal flaws in the slapdash system. Unless ministers want more victims’ blood on their hands, they will pause this dangerous experiment and reinstate hard shoulders.\xa0 During the pandemic, the Government often treated care home residents with callous disregard. Infected hospital patients were blithely discharged into nursing homes, triggering fatal Covid outbreaks.\xa0 Then an inhumane visiting ban denied the vulnerable the touch of a loved one. Now, another blow. Unless free testing is extended, families face paying more than £100 a month.\xa0 If they can’t afford it, elderly relatives will suffer by not having a visit.

17,3/16/2022,Warm embrace for the victims of Putin's war,"There are those who would have us believe that Brexit has made this country a more selfish, inward-looking place.

On Monday, the first day of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, more than 44,000 people came forward, offering to take in those escaping the horrors of war. Last night it had topped 122,300. Britain has a proud history of giving sanctuary to the dispossessed and this is just the latest chapter. It proves we are as welcoming as we ever were to those in need, putting the doubters and cynics to shame. Daily Mail readers, too, are breaking all campaign records. You have helped raise an incredible £7.2million for our Ukraine appeal, vital funds which are already reaching the front line. At a refugee centre on the Romanian border that has benefited from your donations, aid worker Nicoleta Daneliuc praised readers’ generosity. ‘Without their help we could not manage,’ she said. For your remarkable kindness and humanity, the Mail salutes you all. Threat to a free Press Never has the free Press and media been more important than at this pivotal moment in European history. With Vladimir Putin throwing up a smokescreen of fake news to mask his barbaric war on Ukraine, Western journalists risk life and limb daily to tell the real story. Their heroics remind us that freedom of expression is not a given. It must be cherished and fought for. Even here in Britain the free Press is under threat. The revised Online Safety Bill due to be published on Thursday is designed to make social media firms responsible for tackling illegal content and protecting children from online harms. But for all its undoubted good intentions, it contains a highly dangerous flaw. Algorithms used by tech giants to remove harmful material could also block the online output of bona fide news organisations. For example, legitimate stories about terrorism or child abuse could be blocked by default – with crushing effect on press freedom. Thankfully Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries recognises the problem and says she has ‘every intention of further improving the requirements for platforms not to remove content from recognised media outlets’. This welcome acknowledgement must be followed by detailed proposals to amend the Bill. In an ideal world, legitimate online news outlets would be taken out of it altogether. Failing that, they must be fully protected against unintended censorship. We simply can’t allow algorithms dreamed up in Silicon Valley to dictate what the British public should, and should not, be allowed to know. Degrees of hypocrisy After Nottingham University withdrew the offer of an honorary degree from black charity boss Tony Sewell after he suggested Britain may not be ‘institutionally racist’, the Mail took a look at those who have been honoured by that establishment. Glowing examples include various bigwigs from the freedom-loving Chinese Communist Party and a former Malaysian prime minister jailed for embezzling millions from the state. By comparison Mr Sewell, whose principal mission is to help black youngsters into university, is a saint. Yet his eminently sensible views on race and education are deemed ‘too controversial’ to qualify him for an honorary degree. Universities are meant to be cockpits of ideas and debate. Sadly, many seem to have lost their way. As this travesty shows, they have caved in to cancel culture and the monochrome orthodoxy of the illiberal Left.\xa0","Nadine, Tony Sewell, Nicoleta Daneliuc, Vladimir Putin, Mr Sewell, Mail, Bill",daily_mail
18,2/14/2022,Russian investors display war chat scepticism,"Russian investors are not fully buying Washington’s warnings of imminent war. Global stocks dropped and safe-haven government bonds rose on Monday after the United States said Moscow could invade Ukraine at any time. Though Russian assets also wobbled, they have yet to price in the toughest economic sanctions.American warnings that an attack could happen in days pushed stories about the build-up of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border to the top of financial news websites. However, the prospect of war with its neighbour was much less prominent in the Russian media. That reflects the disconnect between western warnings and the messaging from the Kremlin, which has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion.Markets reflect the division. While traders rushed into the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, Russian assets aren’t pricing in the worst-case scenarios. Take Sberbank (SBER.MM), whose shares slipped 5% on Monday. Russia’s biggest lender has erased last year’s gains but is still valued at around 1 times book value, according to Refinitiv data, compared with around 0.8 times in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. If American and European governments impose sanctions on Russian banks, many foreign investors, who held around 43% of Sberbank as of the latest filing, will probably have to sell. The rouble-based MOEX index, which slid around 3% on Monday, is still above its recent lows in late January.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe rouble is also proving resilient to talk of war. Granted, President Vladimir Putin has insulated Russia’s economy against western retaliation, and last week’s rate hike by the central bank helped prop up the currency. But investors are not pricing in anything like the recession triggered by sanctions in 2014, when the rouble lost almost 45% of its value against the dollar.

19,2/22/2022,Risk of war implies lasting Russia discount,"Vladimir Putin is testing the West’s mettle. The Russian president ordered ""peacekeeping"" troops into the breakaway Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, having recognised them as independent on Monday. Limited new European sanctions may not be enough to stop the situation deteriorating. But even if Putin goes no further now, the war discount on Russian assets is here to stay.Putin’s actions look designed to muddy the debate about what constitutes an invasion. Russia-backed separatist forces were already in those regions. It’s also not clear if Russia was recognising the areas currently held by separatists, or also the parts of those regions which are still controlled by Kiev.That may explain why the West’s timid initial response. . Washington has prohibited new trade by U.S. persons with the rebel regions. Britain has sanctioned three billionaires and five Russian banks, but avoided the biggest ones, Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM). Germany halted approval of a new gas pipeline.

If troops remain in the areas currently controlled by separatists, the immediate threat may ease. Yet even a pause in hostilities may not be the end.

As payback, Russia may hack American energy firms and banks, and it won’t take much to cause real damage.The White House on Tuesday dubbed Russia’s moves  read more  so far an “invasion,” opening the door to economic punishment. Although not yet named by U.S. officials, big Russian firms like VTB Bank (VTBR.MM), Sberbank (SBER.MM) and Gazprombank could be cut off from U.S. dollar transactions while oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin could have their assets parked at Western firms frozen. That would set the stage for Russian retaliation.The White House imposed similar sanctions on Iran 10 years ago, and Iranians hit back through cyber attacks.

In 2018, U.S. officials accused Moscow of being behind hacks that targeted American utilities and power grids. Instead of directly attacking companies, it went after their suppliers. Smaller contractors often have less cyber defenses and can be penetrated stealthily. Hackers were also able to steal data of some 40 million Target (TGT.N) customers in 2013 by zeroing in on a heating and air conditioning company the retailer worked with.The Colonial Pipeline hackthat shut down its network last year is an example of the potential harm. It disrupted fuel supplies to the eastern United States and spurred panic buying at gas stations. The company said it paid almost $5 million to regain access to its system after the ransomware attack.The United States government has tried to beef up its cyber capabilities, but it is hard to catch everything, and hackers only have to be lucky once.

Biden leads a divided country and faces congressional elections later this year. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under police investigation over lockdown-busting parties at home. French President Emmanuel Macron will seek re-election in April. And while Putin’s aggression may help unify the European Union, its leaders have little experience of providing a robust response to a military threat.The Russian invasion will also increase frictions in global markets already fractured by the pandemic. American restrictions on exports of semiconductors and other technology to Russia will impel others like China to become less dependent on Western hardware and software.

22,2/24/2022,"China has already won, and lost, in Ukraine","Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine throws mud at President Xi Jinping’s feet. China’s primary pillar of its foreign policy is “non-interference”: the idea sovereignty is sacrosanct, which resonates with many developing countries sick of being lectured by the West. Now, with explosions rocking the capital Kyiv, Chinese diplomats are stuck defending behaviour in practice they loudly condemn in principle. Nor will the world’s largest oil importer appreciate $105 barrels of oil as it grapples with slowing economic growth.The Sino-Russian relationship was once quite hostile. Their armies have exchanged fire over border disputes, and older Chinese still remember how Russia pried Mongolia away from China in the early 20th century. But the two share a common interest in insulating their supply chains and financial systems from America and have moved closer together diplomatically. Economically Russia is also a secure source of energy. The bilateral trade relationship was worth around $140 billion in 2021, per Chinese state media.It’s unclear whether China believed Putin’s threats were mere bluster to help it extract security guarantees from the NATO. Wang Yi, the country’s top diplomat, stated last week on the record that Ukraine is no exception to the sovereignty principle.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThere is a silver lining. Xi has been losing global popularity contests for years without feeling too much pain, and China’s neighbours don’t take its position of non-interference seriously: the People’s Liberation Army invaded Vietnam in 1979. As the West focuses on punishing Russia financially as much as they can afford to, Beijing might catch a break from U.S. containment efforts.An isolated Russia will need China even more to buy its energy and wheat, and to soften the impact of U.S. financial sanctions. Owing Putin no favours, Xi will drive hard bargains. China could use more Russian natural gas to meet emissions reductions targets, but the country has other supply options, improving its negotiating hand. It may also gain leverage in Central Asia, Russia’s backyard.

23,2/24/2022,Ukraine war flashes neon warning lights for chips,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  read more  by land, air and sea risks reverberating across the global chip industry and exacerbating current supply-chain constraints. Ukraine is a major producer of neon gas critical for lasers used in chipmaking and supplies more than 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon, according to estimates from research firm Techcet. About 35% of palladium, a rare metal also used for semiconductors, is sourced from Russia. A full-scale conflict disrupting exports of these elements might hit players like Intel , which gets about 50% of its neon from Eastern Europe according to JPMorgan.The pain won’t fall evenly. ASML (ASML.AS), which supplies machines to semiconductor makers, sources less than 20% of the gases it uses from the crisis-hit countries. Companies may turn to China, the United States and Canada to boost supplies, says JPMorgan. But this may be a slow path. Although the chipmaking industry was able to manage an increase in neon prices stemming from the 2014 Crimean crisis, the scale of today’s conflict looks much larger.

The country’s biggest financial firm, Sberbank (SBER.MM), can no longer use U.S. counterparts to transfer money. Another bank, VTB (VTBR.MM), faces harsher sanctions that include freezing U.S. assets.Extensive export controls may prove even more troubling for Russian President Vladimir Putin. American businesses that sell certain products to Russian entities are now effectively banned from doing so unless they obtain licenses, which will mostly be denied. Those items include computers, information security gear, lasers and sensors. The curbs are designed to include foreign goods produced using U.S. equipment, software and blueprints. The U.S. Commerce Department said it is the most comprehensive application of restrictions targeting a single nation.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterHuawei's experience shows the pain these limits can cause.

Isolated from American suppliers, though not blocked as thoroughly elsewhere as the Ukraine-related sanctions may achieve, the company said in December it expected a nearly 30% drop in revenue in 2021 compared to the previous year.Putin needs sophisticated semiconductors for the government-controlled internet he wants to build. And Russia's burgeoning technology sector could suffer, including New York-listed Yandex (YNDX.O), which started life as a search engine and expanded to food delivery, shopping, taxis and other services, or e-commerce group Ozon (OZON.O) which listed in New York in 2020. Russians might also find their president's war less palatable if, among other hardships, they find it’s more difficult to buy the smartphones they want.For the West, export restrictions have the benefit of spurring less economic blowback than the harshest financial sanctions might produce for banks, investors and the energy sector.

27,3/1/2022,How Europe can kick its Russian gas habit,"Europe needs to wean itself off Russian gas. The Ukraine crisis has shown the folly of relying on Moscow for a large chunk of the continent’s 500 billion cubic metres (bcm) of annual supplies. Kicking the habit will take a concerted decade-long push.Last year Russia piped about 150 bcm of gas to Europe. Shrinking that to zero over a decade means replacing 15 bcm a year. Yet Europe is also phasing out 100 bcm of coal-fired electricity on climate concerns, and its own production of gas is declining at 5 bcm a year. So Europe would need to make up an annual shortfall of 30 bcm, according to Bernstein analysts.Renewable energy can fill some of the gap. If European countries keep building at the current rate, new wind and solar power projects will provide the equivalent of 11 bcm and 6.5 bcm, respectively. If the United States sends a third of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, up from 20% last year, that’s a further 6.8 bcm. Delaying the planned phase-out of existing nuclear power stations would replace 4.8 bcm of gas demand. Finally, investing in building insulation and installing 2 million new electric heat pumps instead of gas boilers every year would save a further 4 bcm.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAll this combined would provide 33 bcm of replacement power a year. But apart from cranking up wind and solar, which are already cheaper than fossil fuels, none of the other steps are straightforward. LNG suppliers ship to where prices are highest, and Europe’s facilities that turn the liquid fuel back into gas aren’t evenly distributed. Nuclear power is politically and environmentally contentious, and heat pumps require extensive subsidies.To pull it off, Europe’s politicians will need help. Historically minded analysts wonder if the United States can reprise the spirit of the 1940s, when it provided funds to rebuild Europe and mobilised an airlift to Berlin. For a start, America could put pressure on Qatar, Australia and its own private companies to divert LNG cargoes to Europe. It could also help finance subsidies for heat pumps, or bolster Europe’s inadequate gas storage facilities.Domestic consumers could help too. If 500 million Europeans took a cold shower and turned the heating off one day a month, they would reduce gas consumption by 4 bcm annually, Bernstein reckons. Shaking Europe’s addiction to Russian gas will require everyone to pitch in.Reuters Graphics Reuters GraphicsFollow @gfhay, @LJucca on Twitter(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces mounting pressure from Europe and Washington to align against Russia, but quick-shifting geopolitical sands make the decision a more delicate one than for most countries.In a diplomatic nod, New Delhi abstained in two votes against Russia’s interests at the U.N.

He is in no hurry to oppose a country that has been a mostly reliable partner for decades on Chinese matters and India’s tussle with Pakistan over Kashmir.The case for preserving the Russian relationship is rooted in a mutual desire for strategic autonomy. It extends well beyond any Indian ambition to protect its biggest defence supplier, a legacy of the Cold War. Russia’s top trading partner is China, India’s adversary. India’s biggest trading partner is the United States, whose tension with China persists. Those dynamics mean India and Russia help each other curb the other’s dependence on a superpower.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterWhat’s more, while India is a vital part of the so-called Quad that implicitly aims to check China’s economic and military regional expansion, the alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia is relatively new.

29,3/3/2022,China’s Belt and Road strafed by Vladimir Putin,"Russia is destroying what China is trying to build. Having refused to condemn President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and suppressed domestic criticism of Russia, Beijing is alienating many eastern European countries where it is constructing trade, investment and technology relationships under its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.Ukraine is strategically positioned across rail, road and energy pipelines linking Russia to the rest of Europe. Since it joined President Xi Jinping’s signature infrastructure policy in 2017, Chinese companies have been upgrading the country’s ports and subways. And in 2020 Kyiv signed a memorandum of understanding with telecoms giant Huawei Technologies, which the United States has been trying to drive out of worldwide networks. With a population of 44 million, Ukraine provides an attractive market for companies such as smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810.HK), and it is an important source of agricultural produce. China bought 30% of its corn imports from Ukraine in 2021.With Russian army convoys advancing toward Kyiv, Beijing is stuck watching missiles wreck a country once receptive to its overtures. The attacks are galvanizing pan-European sentiment against China, which refuses to call Russia’s move an invasion. As the West and Moscow make it harder for private companies to transact, the flow of goods along the “Iron Silk Road,” a rail system across which $75 billion of Chinese products travelled to Europe in 2021, is likely to slow.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAnother casualty of war might be China’s relationship with Poland, which has been trying to strike its own balance between Beijing and Washington.

Former Soviet satellites are aligning more closely with NATO and the European Union, further undermining Beijing’s strategy in the region.China’s investment in the EU was already cooling.

To insulate itself, China may accelerate its push to reduce dependence on foreign imports and enact deeper reforms to spur the internationalisation of its currency. Alternatively, Chinese officials might reconsider the confrontational doctrine with the West, and reflexive anti-Americanism that blinded it to Russia risks.Ultimately, the legislators have little real power.

31,3/4/2022,Euro's Ukraine battering intensifies ECB migraine,"A slumping euro will aggravate European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde’s already difficult policy predicament. The euro zone economy is more exposed than other regions to the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the knock-on effects of sanctions, which is why the single currency is falling. Its broad-based slide will make imports more expensive and exacerbate high inflation.The euro on Friday fell below $1.10 for the first time in nearly two years and was on track for its biggest daily percentage decline since March 2020, a time of massive demand for dollar funding as Covid-19 hit the West. Something similar is happening again, making the greenback generally strong. A gauge of funding stress in global financial markets, the gap between the U.S three-month forward interest rate and the three-month overnight index swap rate, just hit its highest since May 2020. But this time, Europe’s single currency is also displaying independent weakness: It slid to a seven-year low against the Swiss franc and to its weakest since 2016 against the British pound.There are good reasons. Europe had close commercial ties with Russia so war and sanctions will inflict damage on euro zone exporters and its companies’ supply chains. In 2021, Russia was the fifth-largest partner for EU exports of goods and the third largest for EU imports of goods, according to the European Commission. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, was both the largest importer of goods from the country and the largest exporter of goods there.

33,3/7/2022,Breakingviews: Russia’s reverse globalisation will test Putin,"Russia spent three decades integrating itself into the global economy. The repercussions of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are winding the clock back in a matter of weeks. It’s a real-time test of how a nation copes when Western technology, capital and consumer goods are suddenly cut off.The speed with which Russia has unplugged from the developed world is breathtaking. Economic sanctions and public outrage are compelling big companies like Apple (AAPL.O), Nike and Ikea to halt Russian sales  read more . Shipping groups have suspended container traffic while international air travel has stopped. Oil giants and global accounting firms are pulling out. Moody’s, which last week deemed Russian government debt worthy of an investment grade rating, now says the country is at risk of default  read more .The rupture is deliberate. Financial sanctions imposed by America, Europe and Japan exposed big weaknesses in Putin’s economic defences, disabling as much as half the country’s $630 billion stash of foreign exchange reserves and triggering a run on the rouble  read more . Restrictions on exports of computers, telecoms kit and aircraft parts will hobble Russian industry, which has been increasingly enmeshed into global supply chains. Putin and his officials have responded by preventing capital from leaving the country, abruptly severing intricate financial links.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAmbiguity over the reach of sanctions – and the possibility of further measures – have magnified their disruptive impact. Technology suppliers have stopped fulfilling orders while their lawyers work out what’s permitted. And though Western countries are currently still allowed to buy Russian oil and gas, buyers risk a backlash, as Shell (SHEL.L) found after picking up a discounted cargo of crude on Friday  read more . Banks and payments providers are wary of transferring cash, even if sanctions do not apply.Putin has ways to limit the damage. Russia’s need for foreign capital is limited as exports have exceeded imports every year since 1998 due to overseas sales of energy, which the International Monetary Fund reckons contributed roughly 11% of GDP last year. While the United States is now discussing an oil embargo and Europe plans to rapidly kick its Russian gas habit, China and India may over time prove more willing buyers of Russian hydrocarbons. And the People’s Republic – already Russia’s largest trade partner – can supply some of the electronics and machinery that the West will no longer deliver. Such a pivot will take years, however.This is not the only example of globalisation going backwards. The United States has in recent years become more hostile to Chinese investment, while the People’s Republic wants to depend less on U.S. technology. This has prompted suggestions that the two economies could decouple entirely. Meanwhile, the global pandemic has forced governments to reconsider their reliance on distant suppliers for everything from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors. Pariah states like Iran have operated under various types of U.S.-led sanctions for decades, while North Korea has been pursuing self-sufficiency since the 1950s. But no large country has completely exited the global trade and financial system that emerged after the Cold War.The consequences of Russia’s reverse globalisation are therefore hard to predict. In the short term, life will get worse. Putin’s government can ramp up domestic production of some goods, but others are impossible to replace in the short term. Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N), which have stopped delivering spare parts and servicing aircraft in Russia, supplied all but nine of flag carrier Aeroflot’s (AFLT.MM) 186-strong fleet. Russia struggles to make its own semiconductors, so products from cars to mobile phone equipment will become scarce. Businesses that use software provided by the likes of SAP (SAPG.DE) and Oracle (ORCL.N), which have both halted sales and support, will have to rethink their systems.Increasing isolation will widen an economic gap that 30 years of globalisation has failed to close. Russian citizens on average produced about three times as much economic output in real terms in 2020 as three decades earlier, but wealthier Western economies did at least as well, according to World Bank data. In 1990, America’s output per head of population was almost seven times Russia’s; in 2020, the ratio was still over six times.Many Russians will therefore barely register the disappearance of BMW , Netflix or Johnnie Walker. Nevertheless, they have become unwilling participants in a real-time test of what happens when a country tries to rewind globalisation at warp speed. Whether Russians are willing to accept the consequences will help determine whether Putin continues his deadly assault on Ukraine, or whether he is eventually forced to back down.Follow @peter_tl on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

34,3/7/2022,"Stagflation, like worst of pandemic, is avoidable","Sanctions designed to hurt Russia for its invasion of Ukraine will also harm the world economy. Just the prospect of a ban on Western imports of Russian oil catapulted the price of a barrel of Brent crude to $139 on Monday, its highest since 2008. Surging energy and commodity costs mean high inflation is inevitable. Economic stagnation or recession, the other half of the ""stagflation"" spectre, is more avoidable.The euro zone is particularly dependent on Russian energy and is therefore the most exposed to stagflation risks, though the United States isn\'t immune. Goldman Sachs analysts estimate a sustained $20 rise in oil prices would erode euro zone GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points this year. If Russian natural gas stopped flowing, an additional 2.2 percentage points would be lopped off, they say. That would put paid to most of the economic expansion expected by the European Commission, which in February forecast growth of 4% for 2022.Such an outcome wouldn’t be as bad as the pandemic-driven economic collapse in 2020. And governments can mitigate the shock, just as they did then. They can shield the poorest in society from surging food and heating costs by increasing payouts to the unemployed and to low-income households. Finance ministers can reduce taxes on energy and food products or on a range of consumer goods. They also have the option to defer tax hikes, like the one that’s planned in April by Britain’s Rishi Sunak.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThat said, governments face different challenges this time. First, high inflation means central banks are, for now, going to be raising interest rates to tighten financial conditions rather than easing them. Second, the public sector is already burdened with borrowing from Covid-19 measures. General government debt in advanced economies hit 122.7% of GDP in 2020, up nearly a fifth from the previous year, and has only retreated slightly since, according to the International Monetary Fund.There’s also a cost to doing nothing: lower growth and rising unemployment would mean more people in economic distress and higher welfare outlays. Meanwhile, governments would pay a political price in forthcoming elections for high fuel prices if they do nothing, though more borrowing may also be unwelcome. Resisting economic stagnation means accepting yet more Big Government.Follow @swahapattanaik on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

35,3/9/2022,Ukraine speeds global rush to self-sufficiency,"Brexit, trade wars between the United States and China, and Covid-19 have dealt successive knocks to globalisation, and the war in Ukraine is doing fresh damage. The unprecedented speed and severity with which American, European and Russian officials have derailed supply chains is a warning to nations that have just barely emerged from the pandemic.President Vladimir Putin’s threat  read more  to cut Europe’s energy supplies and his decree banning exports of certain products and raw materials in response to sanctions is a potent illustration  read more  of the pitfalls of trusting in free trade. Russian companies can no longer buy semiconductors from the world’s top supplier TSMC and Russian people can’t use their Visa (V.N) and Mastercard overseas. Had Russia not invaded Ukraine, restrictions would not have been applied, and they would be partially wound down if Moscow agrees to withdraw. But for governments worried about being subjected to similar treatment someday, or those simply stuck in the cross-fire, the sight of the West wrecking a G20 economy over the course of just a few weeks gives food for protectionist thought.During the pandemic, officials facing shortages of key medical equipment or electronics components rushed to onshore or re-route crucial supply chains as much as they could, with mixed success. Now, with Moscow warning of $300 per barrel oil prices and farmers panicking that lack of fertiliser will halve crop yields, this decoupling trend is now likely to accelerate.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterCountries cannot quickly reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, so this may spur green transitions as governments ramp up efforts to wean themselves off imported fossil fuels. That’s a good thing, but they are also more likely to slap higher taxes on imported goods to spur local production, roll out more policy favouring domestic champions and scrutinise or halt cross-border deals and investment.Self-sufficiency also implies more global inefficiency as countries duplicate goods and services better imported, and will further increase the price of key commodities. China’s push for self-reliance, for example, has led to massive overcapacity which it shovels into export markets, a tension that led to the trade war in the first place. If everyone moves in the same direction, they could quickly run out of export customers.

38,3/10/2022,McDonald’s closure marks ending of Russian era,"Memory can be fuzzy. I remember a bright, crisp winter day. Photographs tell me the sky was the more usual Moscow grey, with puddles on the pavement suggesting it might have been raining shortly before. Where memory and pictures agree is that a crowd of thousands of patient Muscovites had come early that morning to Pushkin Square, one of the most iconic places in the Russian capital, to get a taste of a McDonald’s (MCD.N) burger.It was Jan. 31, 1990. Russian journalists, foreign correspondents like me, and even a few diplomats had joined the impatient crowd, not wanting to miss the opening of the first ever McDonald’s restaurant in what was still the Soviet Union. A few dozen policemen had been dispatched in case the crowd got out of control.Reporters gathered around George Cohon, the 52-year-old Canadian who had taken the initiative to bring American fast food to Russia. The rumour was that McDonald’s had avoided the country for political reasons, preferring to let the operator of its franchises north of the U.S. border take the first step. Cohon explained how he had toured Soviet farms – which were still mostly inefficient, and all under state ownership – to find suitable cows to turn into beefburgers. He also imported a special variety of potato, to be grown in Russian fields, which would make the right kind of French fries.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporters feverishly scribbling down these details knew they had a significance beyond ordinary Russians’ appetite for all things American, or their eagerness to devour burgers and Big Macs when the restaurant opened at 10 a.m.For locals and foreigners alike, the opening was the first physical confirmation, just two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev was serious, if incoherent at times, about economic and political reform. The golden arches signalled that democratisation and liberalisation were irreversible. The proof was in the eating of a Big Mac.More than three decades later, history has gone into reverse. McDonald’s said this week it would close its 850 restaurants in Russia  read more , arguing it could not ignore the “needless human suffering” caused by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Chicago-based company said the closure was temporary, though this seems more of an expression of hope than a plan. McDonald’s said it would still pay its 62,000 Russian employees but acknowledged that it was “impossible to predict when (the restaurants) might be able to reopen.”McDonald’s no longer has the same scarcity value. Russian diners could until recently get their fast food from a range of outlets including KFC, pizza purveyor Papa John’s , and Burger King, among others. Several of those have now halted their operations or stopped investing in Russia, while coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O) has also shut its doors.Yet for those with longer memories McDonald’s still has symbolic relevance. It was the first major international brand to set up shop in Moscow. Pizza Hut followed a few months later. At the time the USSR had less than two years to live, but it was still hard to imagine that Russia would enter a wild decade of unruly privatisations, that a new caste of oligarchs would take over the country’s mineral resources, or that foreign investors would flock to the Russian capital in search of hefty returns.In 1990, most Russians were forbidden from holding foreign currencies, so McDonald’s priced its burgers in the non-convertible rouble. The downside was that a Big Mac cost between 2% and 3% of the average Russian’s monthly salary. The equivalent bill in the United States today would be $60.The price wasn’t a deterrent, though, and McDonald’s served more than 30,000 meals that first day. The Big Mac was not just an exotic food but a taste of the United States, whose brands had been a subject of fascination and envy, and of active black-market trading, in the grim years of the Soviet Union.The fast-food chain signalled that Russia was joining the globalising world economy, where Russians were at last allowed to travel. A few months before the opening, citizens had congregated in Pushkin Square to use their new-found freedom to demonstrate and express their impatience at the slow pace of reform. Opening a McDonald’s could almost be seen as Gorbachev’s reply to the protesters: See how real all this is.Today the rapid departure from Russia of Western brands from Apple (AAPL.O) to Zara, combined with the domestic clampdown on citizens’ remaining liberties, shows that none of it was irreversible. These days Pushkin Square is one of the places that the Russian police clears of demonstrators protesting the war in Ukraine.

39,3/11/2022,Russian shoppers weaken case for companies to stay,"Weaker Russian spending power makes it less compelling for companies to stay. Consumer goods giants Procter & Gamble (PG.N) read more , Unilever (ULVR.L) and Nestlé (NESN.S) are among those cutting back in the country while others including McDonald’s (MCD.N) halt operations altogether. They clear the way for local rivals and Asian competitors to pick up market share, but the effects from sanctions weaken the financial logic.The exodus has been swift. Apple (AAPL.O), which can’t send the American chips used in its phones and laptops to Russia because of U.S. restrictions, suspended all sales. Nike and IKEA closed stores. Yoghurt maker Danone (DANO.PA) suspended investments in the country while Unilever also said it would stop importing and exporting to and from Russia.It’s a tougher call for others. No company wants to write off investments or surrender sales, but sanctions were not designed to restrict necessities. That should put less pressure on sellers of food, clothes and the like.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThere are broader considerations, however. Even if cheese and coats aren’t targeted, their producers have complicated multinational operations. Concerns about getting paid and sourcing imported ingredients will weigh on decisions. Even those merely suspending their Russian business are likely to generate lower sales over time.Homegrown operators including retailer Magnit (MGNT.MM) will benefit. Likewise, Chinese companies such as Li Ning (2331.HK) and Anta Sports Products (2020.HK) should be able to take revenue from departing rivals Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Nike. Some outsiders will have their own balancing act: courting Russians while not alienating Western consumers. Uniqlo, the apparel maker owned by Japan’s Fast Retailing (9983.T), on Thursday reversed its original plan to keep selling in Russia.The risks of staying may not be worth it. Discretionary spending is bound to fall in Russia. Despite the country’s large and youthful population, its consumers already have lost 34% of their purchasing power against the yuan since the Ukraine invasion, even with central bank intervention and capital controls.Things will only get worse as the economy slows. Russia's economy is expected by JPMorgan analysts to contract 35% in the second quarter and 7% for 2022. The 3.1% rebound in real Russian disposable incomes last year is destined to fall again.

40,3/11/2022,Dixon: War boosts need for “green Marshall Plan”,"The tragedy in Ukraine should not just spur Europe to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. It should also supercharge international efforts to help emerging economies come off hydrocarbons.The West needs more allies to turn Vladimir Putin into a global pariah, and to show China what will happen if it too throws its weight around. One of the best ways to do this is to drive forward its embryonic plan to help developing countries grow in a green way. This is a massive programme that will ultimately cost trillions of dollars.The West has already done a fairly good job isolating Russia: 141 countries voted against the invasion at last week’s emergency United Nations General Assembly. Putin was backed by a rogue’s gallery: North Korea, Syria, Belarus and Eritrea.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterBut 48 countries either abstained or didn’t vote. These included not just China, but virtually all the Indian subcontinent and half of Africa. Putin is a pariah in the West, but not yet in the rest of the world. In terms of population, about half the world was on the West’s side and half was on the sidelines.This matters in the Ukraine crisis. The more neutral countries there are, the harder it will be for the West to turn the screws on Putin both diplomatically and economically. It also matters because of the potential read-across from Russia to China.To be clear, Beijing isn’t in the same category as Moscow. Hopefully it never will be. Xi Jinping and Putin have cuddled up to each other, saying just before the war that friendship between their countries had “no limits”. But China hasn’t publicly backed the invasion. And though Beijing is detaining Uyghurs in camps, imprisoning pro-democracy protesters and opposition politicians in Hong Kong and sabre-rattling over Taiwan, it hasn’t invaded a foreign country in more than 40 years.The West shouldn't want a Cold War with China. Ideally, it will cooperate with Beijing on areas of common interest, especially climate change. Also, if it does fall out with China, the consequences could be even worse than a new Cold War with Russia. Its economy is 10 times Russia’s size and growing.But the West does need to prepare for the possibility that relations with Beijing enter the deep freeze - and insofar as it prepares well, such a scenario will be less likely. As the Romans said: “Si vis pacem, para bellum.” (If you want peace, prepare for war.) Central to the West’s strategy should be stopping China building a gang of allies, just as further isolating Putin has to be part of the plan to make him pay for Ukraine.The embryonic “green Marshall Plan”, based loosely on the U.S. support packages to rebuild post-war Europe in the 1940s, should be a key plank of this strategy. The Group of Seven (G7) large industrial nations signed up to this idea at last year’s summit, at UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s urging. It was seen as a green alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has been building infrastructure across Asia, Africa and Latin America for the best part of the decade.The G7’s idea is to help developing and emerging economies make fast and fair transitions to net zero. South Africa has already signed such a deal, and several more countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam are interested in following suit.Carbon-intensive industries need to be run down and clean ones created. The lion’s share of the huge investment must come from the private sector and go to private-sector projects. But some public money will be needed to get private capital flowing.All this is promising. But the G7 hasn’t made a song and dance about its new plan – and it has only taken the first steps to mobilise the trillions. Part of the problem is that it doesn’t even have a single name. Johnson calls it the Clean Green Initiative, while Joe Biden prefers Build Back Better for the World. It would be good if they could agree on a single brand, as it would then be easier to motivate key stakeholders.Now is the time to get on the front foot. After all, this initiative speaks to the pressing needs of developing countries. Namely, to drag themselves out of poverty, and to avoid climate change, their real existential threat.By contrast, the Ukraine crisis leaves many developing countries cold. At the United Nations, some accused the West of double standards - for example, for not caring much about wars in non-European countries such as Yemen and Libya.It will take years to roll out a clean and green plan across developing and emerging countries. But the Ukraine crisis could also drag on for a long time. So if the West pushes its clean and green plan hard, it will win more friends vis-à-vis Russia – and the more Putin is isolated, the more Beijing will take note.Mind you, while the West should be trying to turn more countries against Putin, it shouldn’t force countries to break links with China. It will be enough to stop them falling into Beijing’s orbit. After all, China is a threat but not an enemy.The clean and green plan could also prod China to embrace low-carbon technology more vigorously. If it wants to keep supplying infrastructure to developing countries, Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative will have to embrace clean technology. Meanwhile, if lots of emerging countries go green, the West will be able to wean itself off carbon-intensive goods made in China. Beijing will then need to clean up its act at home if it wishes to stay competitive.So a really ambitious clean and green plan hits multiple strategic objectives simultaneously: it further isolates Putin, it prevents Xi Jinping assembling a large gang of supportive countries, it prods China to go green and it helps developing countries grow in a green way. It makes the world safer – from both bullies and climate change.It’s understandable that the West’s leaders are now focused on the immediate tragedy in Ukraine. But it would be a terrible mistake to lose sight of the vital need to save the planet.

41,3/14/2022,Renault’s Russian options range from bad to ugly,"Renault (RENA.PA) is hoping for the best in Russia. Jean-Dominique Senard, the French carmaker’s chairman, said last week that war in Ukraine would not threaten the company’s recovery. Investors who have wiped 40% off its share price in less than a month appear to disagree.Renault is the largest maker and seller of cars in Russia, with close to 30% of the market. It owns two-thirds of Avtovaz, the maker of Lada cars, and operates its two plants. The company also makes cars under its own brands in a Moscow factory.However, the loss of 4 billion euros of market value may look an overreaction. Avtovaz brought in just 6% of the group’s 46 billion euros of revenue last year, and is valued at 3 billion euros in Renault’s balance sheet.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterNevertheless, Renault has no good options in Russia. The company shut its operations there after President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine last month. Trucks carrying crucial semiconductors couldn’t reach the factories. The Avtovaz plants, which use fewer imported components, may reopen this week.With 40,000 mostly Russian employees, Renault cannot just shut up shop and leave. The Russian government is also threatening to take over companies more than 25% owned by “foreigners from unfriendly states” if they threaten to close their local operations.The French company is familiar with Putin’s approach to nationalisation. After Avtovaz became the target of brutal wars between armed gangs, the government effectively took control in the mid-2000s by sending hundreds of armed policemen to a shareholder meeting.Renault bought into Avtovaz in 2008 after Rostec, a major defence player, was tasked with cleaning it up. This alliance has added to the French headache. Rostec, which retains a one-third stake, is headed by Sergey Chemezov, a close Putin ally sanctioned by Western governments. Rostec is also the majority shareholder of Novikombank, one of the seven lenders excluded from the Swift international payments network earlier this month.Some of Russia’s nationalist newspapers have questioned why Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state, should be allowed to operate in the country. In the rest of the world, the company’s brand could suffer from its associations with the Russian military. A bad situation could soon turn uglier.Follow @pirrebri on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

42,3/14/2022,War crowdfunding is weapon that cuts two ways,"Crowdfunding has been supercharged as a weapon of war. Ukraine has raised more than $100 million through cryptocurrencies and a central bank link, putting a new spin on an old trend of outside funding for conflicts. The catch is both sides can take advantage of technology that makes it easier and faster to support a fight.There’s nothing new about foreigners and diaspora populations contributing amid clashes. Polish immigrants volunteered to fight and donated money in the Russo-Polish conflict after World War One; Americans did the same in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. Technology has made it more convenient. Cryptocurrency transfers take seconds where international bank payments take days. Apps like Apple Pay and PayPal-owned (PYPL.O) Venmo have also made it easier to send funds.Ukraine has embraced those innovations with some success. A few days after Russian invaded the country last month, Ukraine's minister for digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted crypto wallet addresses to which people could donate. About $64 million has poured into various accounts as of Friday, according to crypto data firm Elliptic. A website run by the National Bank of Ukraine, which accepts Google Pay among other payment methods, has received around $40 million for the army and humanitarian needs.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterDigital donations could benefit both sides, though. True, it will be harder for Russia to raise global funds given the raft of Western sanctions imposed on it. But there’s nothing stopping Moscow from trying. Vladimir Putin’s regime may have luck in countries that have been more aligned with it like China and India. While the U.S. authorities have warned companies that sanctions cover cryptocurrencies  read more  too, that doesn’t fully cover transactions in fiat currencies like the Chinese yuan.In 2003, the Eritrean government raised $25 million to support armed groups fighting against the Ethiopian government, a conflict that led to global sanctions against Eritrea, according to late economics professor Tekie Fessehatzion.

45,3/16/2022,Russia punches economic hole above its weight,"Russia’s sudden disappearance  read more  from global trade leaves a big economic hole. After being isolated for most of the Cold War, the country became a major commodities exporter. That’s why the loss of an economy smaller than the U.S. state of Texas is pushing up global prices for energy, metals and wheat.The Soviet Union wasn’t a major factor in international commerce. In 1985 global trade, mostly with Eastern Europe, accounted for just 4% of its gross national product. Trade made up about 17% of American GDP in the same year. Mismanagement and poor harvests led the Soviet Union to import grain for much of the 1970s and 80s.The arrival of Mikhail Gorbachev as the Soviet leader in 1985 opened the door to international markets. After the union collapsed in 1991, Russia broke into the world’s top 25 trading countries, accounting for about 1% of global exports, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Its share peaked at nearly 3% but took a hit after President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea in 2014.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAt first Russia’s biggest export destinations were Germany, the United States and Italy, which predominantly bought oil and gas. It wasn’t until 2002 that the country became a meaningful supplier of wheat for foreign markets, making up almost 6% of global exports, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.As agriculture became a smaller part of America’s economic output, Russia stepped in. In 1995, Uncle Sam was the top overseas seller of fertilizer with almost 17% of the market; Russia supplied about 10%. Eight years later, Russia took the lead. It became the top wheat exporter  read more  in 2016.By 2020, overseas trade made up 46% of Russia’s GDP, World Bank figures show. Oil and gas still provided more than half its exports, with metals accounting for 11%, chemicals about 8% and food products 7%.That is now rapidly drying up, in part due to sanctions; America and the United Kingdom have stopped buying Russian oil, for example. Meanwhile, buyers are shunning Russian goods due to fear of future restrictions as well as difficulties in making payments. Putin has also halted some outflows. Moscow last Thursday said it would ban certain exports of agricultural, automotive and medical products until the end of the year.Russia still has willing customers like China, already its biggest export destination, while India may buy the country’s oil and other goods at a discount, two officials told Reuters on Monday. Countries that accounted for at least 35% of Russia’s overseas markets have yet to impose sanctions or cut economic ties. Still, even some of those nations are finding it hard to transport goods through the Black Sea.Russia’s sudden pariah status has therefore sparked a global scramble for alternate supplies for everything from gas to nickel to fertilizer. For example, Russia is the second-biggest seller of sunflower seed oil. Heightened demand for alternatives has prompted Indonesia to restrict exports of palm oil, which is used in everything from margarine to chocolate.Other commodity producers have stepped up, capitalizing on a surge in prices. Bigger exports of wheat from the European Union, along with record crops in Australia and India, can help offset the loss from Russia and Ukraine, according to a March report by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Others are taking matters into their own hands  read more . The agriculture minister of Brazil, one of the top buyers of Russian fertilizer, visited Canada, the world’s third-largest exporter, this month to inquire about more potash supplies.More than a third of emerging markets have benefited from a 20% jump in export prices since the beginning of this year, according to a recent Oxford Economics report. Colombia has seen a more than 40% boost to its terms of trade because of an increase in demand for coal exports, including from Europe. Countries like Japan and Vietnam, traditionally big importers of Russian coal, will likely turn to Australia and Indonesia.But commodity exporters also have to factor in the higher cost of imports. The United Nations food price index was up more than 20% year-on-year in February, before Russia invaded. Colombia’s consumer price index already reached a record high in February. In the previous month, the country’s central bank increased its key interest rate from 3% to 4%, the biggest hike in almost 20 years.

48,3/17/2022,Russia kicks default drama into future,"Russia seems to have blinked in the face of a bond market drama. After two weeks of toying with the idea of sending roubles rather than dollars to foreign creditors, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that $117 million had been sent to a U.S. correspondent bank for bond interest payments  read more . Some creditors had yet to receive the money they were owed on Thursday morning, but if Siluanov is right, default will have been avoided, at least for now.Risking default by paying the coupons in roubles would have been a political decision more than a financial one. While Western sanctions are crippling its economy, Russia can still access at least a third of the $630 billion in gold and foreign currencies it held before the war in Ukraine. And it is still getting revenue from the oil and gas it keeps selling to Europe and other clients like China. The country’s sovereign debt in dollars only amounts to some $39 billion.The game of chicken will depend on the outcome of the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Putin has reasons to want to avoid default. Not paying creditors would mean years of legal wrangling in foreign courts. It would also put an end to his attempts to diversify the economy by forcing Russia to rely even more on the revenue from oil and gas.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe possibility of a compromise that might end hostilities seemed to emerge Wednesday. Moscow might hope that an accord will clear the way for a return to business as usual. This is unlikely to happen, but could at least put an end to debt brinkmanship.Avoiding default will, however, become more complicated on May 25, when a temporary reprieve allowing U.S. foreign creditor banks to receive dollar payments from Russia will expire. Moscow will then be able to play the game that Siluanov hinted at this week when he said he didn’t know whether the interest payments would reach their intended recipients.By then, Russia’s economic situation will have deteriorated further. And both Moscow and the sanctioning powers will have had ample time to reflect on all the possible repercussions of a default.Follow @pirrebri on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

When Wall Street’s finest merger bankers and lawyers last convened in New Orleans for the Tulane Corporate Law Institute conference in March 2020, it was less than a week before cities across the United States first shut down to keep Covid-19 at bay. Stocks were plunging, but that didn’t stop advisers from clinking shared shrimp bowls while Centerview Partners founder Blair Effron touted the merits of special-purpose acquisition companies.Two record years of deal activity later, the conference is hopping again, this time against the backdrop of war in Europe.There are reasons to be glum. The S&P 500 Index is down 10% so far this year, and chief executives’ confidence, an important driver of deals, is down significantly from its record high in 2021, according to The Conference Board.

Private equity has more than $3.4 trillion in dry powder, according to Bain & Company, while SPACs looking for targets have $190 billion in trust accounts, SPAC Research reckons.The regulatory environment is top of mind, evidenced by the Tulane keynote address coming from John Coates, formerly the Securities and Exchange Commission’s acting director for corporate finance. Yet even if corporate buyers are pushed to the sidelines, investment firms like Blackstone (BX.N) and Apollo Global Management (APO.N) will seize the moment, just as Elliott Management is doing with its interest, alongside partners, in Nielsen (NLSN.N), a video-ratings business now sporting an enterprise value of nearly $14 billion.It’s possible that the breakneck pace of deals over the past two years will slow.

50,3/21/2022,Tokyo gets helpful shove from unhelpful war,"The Japanese economy is feeling the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But although rising import costs will sting, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is making good use of the crisis so far.Japan, the world’s fifth-largest energy consumer in 2019, relies heavily on fossil fuels, a condition exacerbated by its decision to turn off most of its nuclear reactors after a tsunami caused a meltdown in 2011. That forced a pivot to natural gas, which together with coal and oil comprise nearly 90% of energy consumption. With supply constricted, Japanese buyers are now on the receiving end of skyrocketing import prices just when their economy was starting to turn a corner, a vulnerability exacerbated by sharp currency depreciation. The yen is now trading around 119 per dollar, a level not seen since 2016.Yet while official data showed energy prices popped 20.5% in February, overall consumer price inflation was a tepid 0.9% year-on-year. In fact Japan, by dint of its aging society and investments in efficiency, has become less energy-intense when it comes to driving growth, which is forecast to hit nearly 3% in the current fiscal year. It won’t feel a serious pinch from oil until prices exceed $150 per barrel, according to an analysis by HSBC. Equity investors aren’t panicking; the Topix index is down only 4% in 2022.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAs for the loss of the Russian market, the hit to roughly $8 billion worth of annual exports is manageable. Those consumers are a nice-to-have for brands like Uniqlo, but currency sanctions have made it a liability. Japanese bank exposure to Russia is less than $10 billion, per an analysis by CLSA.The natural gas crunch will accelerate Kishida’s push to re-open the country’s mothballed nuclear plants. That will alleviate the country’s dependence on imports and help it hit its carbon neutral target by 2050.This crisis has also given the government cover to start easing Covid-19 lockdown measures  read more  and reopen borders to tourism, which could ease the impact if foreign demand for Japanese exports plummets.

51,3/22/2022,"On the Ukraine refugee crisis, watch Canada","Canada offers Western countries a path towards handling the fallout from the Ukraine refugee crisis. The country that claims to be the world’s second-largest Ukrainian diaspora has taken a firm stance by offering assistance to those fleeing war after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s policies prove successful, the country could pave the way for others to follow.European countries have scrambled to address the flight of more than 3.5 million Ukrainians caused by Russia’s invasion, with Poland and Romania thus far absorbing the highest influxes among neighboring countries. But Canada’s response stands out given its distance from the crisis. Last Thursday’s launch of an emergency travel scheme, under which Ukrainians and their immediate family members will be able to stay in Canada as temporary residents for up to three years, has received over 20,000 applications so far. Plans for a separate, permanent family reunification route are also underway.Across the border there’s less action, at least officially.

52,3/25/2022,"Russian gas gets harder to buy, but easier to snub","Russian gas is getting harder to buy. President Vladimir Putin sent prices soaring on Wednesday by declaring that Europe should pay for imports of the hydrocarbon in roubles. The gambit could hasten severe economic pain for both Russia and Europe. It may also speed up the West’s plan to de-Russify its energy mix.In a narrow sense, propping up the rouble by forcibly stimulating foreign demand has some logic. Since the Kremlin ordered its troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia’s currency has slumped and Western sanctions have frozen hundreds of billions of dollars of Moscow’s reserves held abroad. But the deeper significance of Putin’s edict is threat escalation. If big European importers like Germany’s Uniper (UN01.DE) refuse to pay in roubles, he could cut off their gas.That would inflict pain in both directions. As Russia supplies over a third of Europe’s gas, turning off the taps would hit the bloc hard.

That means replacing about a fifth of its 524 bcm of overall supply. Aside from hiking renewable energy and turning down thermostats, the biggest factor is a potential 50 bcm of additional LNG imports. Biden’s deal almost certainly underestimates how much extra the United States and peers can export, and Rystad Energy reckons the bloc can handle the load. In theory its terminals have capacity to turn 76 bcm of extra LNG back into usable gas.Biden and von der Leyen don’t have unlimited leverage. LNG is expensive, and REPowerEU requires European gas storage to be 80% full by November. Rystad fears that could require Europe to cut gas usage by 18% relative to 2021.

53,3/28/2022,Foreign cash fleeing China adds insult to injury,"Beijing’s close ties with Moscow may be rattling foreign investors.

The study found no similar outflows from other emerging markets, adding insult to injury.China’s technocrats have only started to make progress attracting global portfolio managers long wary of the People’s Republic. While Chinese shares comprise 9% of global equity values, mainland-listed companies constituted only 2.7% of international investors’ fund allocations in 2020. Strict capital controls, unpredictable policymaking and a shareholder base dominated by day-traders put off serious financial institutions; hedge fund manager Jim Chanos once referred to Chinese markets as a “roach motel” - easy to get money in, hard to get it out.It is now easier for money managers to repatriate funds at will, and embarrassing distortions – like arbitrary trading halts – have been fully or mostly closed.

54,3/30/2022,China-U.S. ties will degrade regardless of Russia,"In many ways, it’s business as usual in Washington when it comes to Beijing.

But longer-running disputes are also still rumbling, possibly reigniting a trade war or screening U.S. investments in the People’s Republic.

55,3/31/2022,Hydrogen’s civil war reveals its winner,"Hydrogen’s civil war is approaching its denouement. Fans of the element, seen as the missing link in the fight against climate change, advocate either its “blue” variant, made from natural gas with most of the carbon captured and removed, or its “green” one, made using renewable electricity. An actual war in Ukraine has allowed green to pull decisively ahead.Much of hydrogen’s excitement relates to its ability to decarbonise heavy industry, one of the trickiest parts of the global economy to clean up. It’s also a handy energy store for when wind and solar power aren’t available. However, only 10% of the 90 million tonnes of hydrogen produced annually is low-carbon, be it blue or green. The remaining 90% is “grey” hydrogen, used mainly in oil refining and fertiliser production. Its manufacture accounts for more than 2% of the world’s annual carbon dioxide emissions. The challenge, according to the Hydrogen Council, is to ramp up overall hydrogen output to over 650 million tonnes a year by 2050, with the vast majority of that being of the low-carbon green or blue varieties.In that light, obsessing over blue or green looks odd. But that hasn’t stopped it happening. Up until last autumn the oil sector-backed blue corner was crowing about the potential for costs under 3 euros per kilogram, based on natural gas prices of under 20 euros per megawatt hour (MWh). The green corner, whose unit costs tend to be at least 4 euros per kg, hit back with a research paper from scientists at Cornell University in the United States lambasting blue hydrogen’s potential to pollute. Ahead of November’s COP26 climate talks, the UK government diplomatically advocated both hues in its hydrogen strategy, only for the pro-green boss of the UK’s hydrogen industry association to quit in protest.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterHowever, even before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and imperiled European gas supplies, blue’s star was waning. Since last summer, natural gas prices have risen fivefold to over 100 euros per MWh. That radically changes the relative cost dynamics. Even with gas at 80 euros per MWh, grey hydrogen works out at 5 euros per kg, Bernstein reckons; blue, which has the added expense of carbon capture, exceeds 6 euros. At this month’s war-driven peaks, both would have topped 10 euros per kg.Carbon costs are a material factor, too. Each 1 kg of hydrogen produces 9 kg of carbon dioxide. At the pre-Ukraine war carbon price of around 90 euros a tonne that’s nearly an extra euro for each kg of grey, and a smaller but tangible cost for blue hydrogen. This expense will rise with the carbon price.The conflict has revealed deeper problems for blue hydrogen, according to Graham Cooley, chief executive of $2.8 billion ITM Power (ITM.L), which makes electrolysis kit to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Besides wildly fluctuating prices, blue hydrogen’s main input – natural gas – may even become unobtainable if shortages lead to rationing. Conversely, green hydrogen’s main input – renewable electricity – has supply driven by the weather, not post-Cold War geopolitics, and costs determined by long-term fixed-price wind and solar power off-take agreements.You’d expect Cooley to say as much – last year he opened a gleaming new electrolyser factory in Sheffield, Northern England. But governments look more likely now to target green rather than blue. The European Union recently quadrupled its 2030 green hydrogen target to 20 million tonnes, and hiked electrolyser capacity plans from 80 to 200 gigawatts (GW).However, green hydrogen is not completely free of supply headaches. Currently, the world excluding China has about 5 GW of electrolyser capacity. Hitting 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030, a distinctly modest target, implies 167 GW of kit, according to Liberum Research. Between them, the big non-Chinese electrolysis players like ITM, Nel (NEL.OL), Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) and Plug Power (PLUG.O) as of year-end had only pledged 90 GW by then. The 2050 ambitions imply a mammoth 4,300 GW of electrolysers, plus an epic increase in wind and solar power generation.Such numbers point to Europe relying on green hydrogen imports and others to ramp up electrolyser supply. A plan by Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest to ship 5 million tonnes of hydrogen annually to Germany by 2030 is punchy but unproblematic geopolitically. Less so is Europe replacing its unhealthy dependence on Russian and Middle Eastern hydrocarbons with an equally questionable dependence on green hydrogen if imports or electrolyser supply chains were controlled by potentially tricky countries like China.As broad as possible an array of suppliers helps avoid such an outcome. In the meantime, ITM’s share price has jumped nearly 50% since the Ukraine war broke out. Assuming green hydrogen really has won its own internecine conflict, it may have a fair way yet to go.Racing greenFollow @gfhay on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- Germany’s largest energy group, E.ON, signed a memorandum of understanding on March 29 with the green power arm of Australian miner Fortescue Metals to explore shipping green hydrogen to Europe.- The agreement with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) will look at ways to ship up to 5 million tonnes a year of hydrogen generated from renewable energy by 2030, the two companies said in a statement.- That roughly corresponds to one-third of the heating energy Germany imports from Russia each year, or 165 terawatts of capacity, FFI Chairman Andrew Forrest said.

Oil, which can travel by ship, is in theory more fungible and therefore less susceptible to an EU ban. It also brought in three times the $60 billion Moscow earned from gas in 2021  read more . Yet Russia’s sulfur-rich Urals crude is harder to refine than, say, Saudi crude, and outside Europe the specialist refining facilities that can handle it are uncommon.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterHowever, halting gas and oil flows would be painful for countries like Germany and Italy that rely on Russian energy. Berlin derives about 55% of its natural gas, half its coal and a third of its oil from Russia. In Germany, a full energy embargo would mean rationing and a further spike in already sky-high hydrocarbon prices.There are alternatives. Europe could impose a cap on the price it was prepared to pay, effectively demanding a discount. Yet such a move would endanger contractual agreements with Russia. A simpler alternative would be to force Moscow to pay a border tax on hydrocarbons arriving in Europe. The concept borrows from the carbon border tax already under discussion to reduce carbon dioxide emissions outside Europe. Importantly, it would not require the breaking of existing contracts.Such a halfway-house option could keep Germany happy while still being relatively painful for Moscow.Follow @LJucca on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

58,4/6/2022,Ukraine should be rebuilt without Russian money,"Natural justice would seem to dictate that Russia be asked to pay reparations for the massive damage inflicted on its neighbour. Political and practical reasons make that impossible, and even undesirable.It’s hard to put a number on the ultimate cost of the destruction. Ukrainian government estimates range from $110 billion  read more , based on destroyed infrastructure, to $500 billion, if potential losses like missed foreign investment are added to the physical tally.A rough estimate leads to a number somewhere in the middle, based on the current state of things. Economists reckon Ukraine’s ratio of invested capital to economic output is around 5. That means its capital stock is around $1 trillion, based on the International Monetary Fund’s pre-war estimates of this year’s GDP at $204 billion. If 20% of the economy’s potential is destroyed, reconstruction will thus cost $200 billion. And the figure rises with each week of the war. It already dwarfs the $135 billion present-day value of the U.S.-led Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe after World War Two. It also amounts to about 12% of Russia’s 2021 GDP.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterOnly a truce – for now distant – can lay the foundations for long-term stability. International bodies such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and World Bank will then assume central fundraising and organising roles, supported by national governments and the European Union. Private investors will follow in the official sector’s wake.Barring a shock regime change, Russia is unlikely to agree to pay for the damage it has inflicted. In any case, its money will not be welcome. As with West Germany in the late 1940s, one of the central ambitions of reconstruction will be to anchor Ukraine more firmly in Europe, with which it already has a free trade agreement. Russian investment must be kept out for Ukraine to stay in.If only to assuage public opinion, Western leaders will still want to hold President Vladimir Putin accountable.

59,4/7/2022,Chancellor: In praise of slack,"In recent decades we have lived through an era of optimisation. In the name of greater efficiency, more and more output has been extracted from a given amount of input. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “optimise” as to “act as an optimist”. The dictionary also notes that “optimism” was “the doctrine propounded by (the German philosopher) Leibnitz … that we live in the best of all possible worlds.” But, like Voltaire’s Candide, we are discovering that isn’t the case. This has important implications for the way companies are managed.American executives were those who most enthusiastically embraced the move to optimisation. Under the banner of delivering shareholder value, companies contracted out manufacturing to suppliers on the other side of the world, ran down inventories – operating instead on a “just-in-time” basis – and replaced equity funding with debt. Optimisation boosted the components that determine return on equity (ROE): corporate profit margins, asset turns and leverage. U.S. public companies boasted the highest returns in the world, reporting a 17% ROE last year, compared with just 9% for their Japanese counterparts.But as Nassim Nicholas Taleb pointed out in his 2012 book “Antifragile”, the pursuit of optimisation creates instability. In recent years, we’ve witnessed a succession of what might be described as “optimisation crises”. The global financial crisis of 2008 showed that undercapitalised banks were overly dependent on the capital markets for liquidity. When Covid-19 struck many countries discovered their public health systems had too few hospital beds and inadequate staffing levels to cope with the pandemic. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has further exposed weaknesses in Europe’s energy system. Not only was Germany hopelessly dependent on Russian oil and gas, but the country had also underinvested in its military.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterOptimisation has rendered the corporate world more fragile. Companies with too much debt are vulnerable to unexpected downturns. Globalisation works wonders when all goes according to plan. But it’s a complex trading system prone to unexpected breakdowns. As Taleb writes, globalisation “brings fragilities, causes more extreme events as a side effect … in such a complex system, the predictability of consequences is very low.” Recent events have borne out his concerns.Pandemic lockdowns disrupted global supply chains, and those disruptions were still unresolved in late February when Russia unleashed the largest military operation in Europe since World War Two. Globalisation has been badly fractured. Earlier this year an American ban on the import of goods manufactured in China’s Xinjiang region caused a pile-up of shipping in the port of Los Angeles. Semiconductors are in such short supply that ASM International (ASMI.AS), a leading European producer of chip manufacturing equipment, can’t get hold of them. Most of the world’s semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, whose independence is constantly threatened by China.The easiest way to reduce fragility is to build more redundancy, or slack, into the system. For instance, after the global financial crisis regulators required banks to hold more capital. The UK government has announced that it will increase the number of healthcare staff available at periods of peak hospital demand. Germany is looking to construct terminals for imports of liquefied natural gas and has promised to spend more on defence. Slack is the new buzzword.The corporate world is also seeking to reduce fragility. Having experienced frequent supply disruptions, some companies are turning away from just-in-time production. Others are looking to bring manufacturing back onshore. Chip giant Intel (INTC.O) plans to build plants in the United States and Germany.The era of optimisation sounded the death knell for vertically integrated companies which owned and controlled the entire production process. The tide could be about to turn. In a recent note entitled “The End of Optimisation”, Julien Garran of MacroStrategy suggests that companies will have to bring more key activities in-house. European luxury goods brands are already buying their suppliers, he says.The return of inflation exacerbates this trend. Rising prices are often accompanied by supply bottlenecks, but also create uncertainty about input costs. Companies typically respond by hoarding stocks, which requires them to operate with more working capital. Higher inflation and interest rates also raise the cost of operating across overextended global supply chains.The end of optimisation will produce winners and losers. So-called “platform” companies that have few physical assets face a bleaker future if they are required to invest in their own manufacturing facilities. Taleb observes that small firms are inherently less fragile than larger ones, while large corporations are doomed to break. These factors make it more likely that “value” stocks, which trade at low multiples relative to their underlying assets, will outperform more highly priced “growth” stocks, Garran predicts.American executives have been the keenest practitioners of optimisation. As a result, U.S. companies sport the highest valuations in the world according to forecasts compiled by Boston-based money manager GMO (my former employer). But these companies have also taken on masses of debt in recent years. In future, it will be harder for companies to boost their earnings per share and stock price simply by borrowing to repurchase their shares. When Howard Schultz, the returning chief executive of Starbucks (SBUX.O), announced this week that the company would end buybacks and spend the cash instead on staff and cafés, the coffee chain’s share price fell. As returns on equity decline, the U.S. stock market will lose its premium rating.The end of optimisation requires fewer financial engineers and more genuine engineers. That should be good news for Japan, one of the few developed economies to have retained its manufacturing base. It’s true that Japanese companies have shifted some production abroad, but they have also been wary of becoming overly dependent on China.The concept of shareholder value has always been viewed with suspicion in Japan, where companies have given priority to the interests of other corporate stakeholders: customers, suppliers, employees and society at large. Japan’s conglomeration of business organisations, known as keiretsu, also operate with plenty of redundancy. In the past, Japanese companies may have delivered suboptimal returns compared to their U.S. counterparts, but they are less indebted and more robustly designed for uncertain times ahead.Follow @Breakingviews on TwitterRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterEditing by Peter Thal Larsen and Oliver TaslicOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

60,4/7/2022,Rouble’s strength is sign of Russia’s weakness,"The Russian rouble’s recent sharp rebound reflects economic weakness, not resilience. After shedding 45% of its value against the dollar in the two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the currency has bounced back and is now trading just below its pre-war level.But the tools that have been used to prop up the rouble make it look like a Potemkin currency – like the fake façades ordered by the eponymous prince to fool Empress Catherine II into thinking Russian villages were prosperous. Since Feb. 24, the day the Russian invasion began, the central bank has raised its key interest rate from 9.5% to 20%, slapped capital controls on much of the economy, and forced Russian exporters to convert their foreign currency revenues into roubles. Meanwhile President Vladimir Putin is trying to make buyers of Russian gas and oil pay in roubles  read more .The efforts to shore up the rouble are in line with one of Putin’s key beliefs. The humiliation of the steep devaluations of the 1990s helps explain why a stable currency has been a key element of policy since he came to power more than 20 years ago. Central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina’s relative independence has been respected because she has been a fierce guardian of the currency’s stability.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterYet the rouble remains at the mercy of any Western embargo on Russian oil and gas. The punitive 20% policy rate will further hurt an economy that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development expects to shrink 10% this year, just on the basis of sanctions already taken. High interest rates will deter investment, trade restrictions will send imported prices higher, and Russians may find they have little use for a stable rouble in their fast-closing economy.A view shows a Russian one rouble coin in this picture illustration taken October 26, 2018. Picture taken October 26, 2018. Sanctions are likely to last longer than analysts seem to expect when they cheer at the smallest indication of a possible compromise between Moscow and Kyiv. But even if they were lifted, the rouble would come crashing down to reality. One of the reasons its exchange rate has recovered is that trading has been particularly thin in the last few weeks.

61,4/8/2022,Putin’s finances can survive a European energy ban,"Russia’s economy will screech along even if it stops exporting energy to Europe. Sanction-free reserves, higher oil prices and a well-oiled propaganda machine would cushion the blow. That makes President Vladimir Putin’s threats to cut the bloc off from gas more credible.On the face of it, an energy embargo, either imposed by Russia or foisted on Putin by Europe, sounds like a death blow for the country’s finances. Its economy is already forecast to contract as much as 15% this year  read more  thanks to Western sanctions.Still, Putin’s budget could prove relatively resilient. Around 9 trillion roubles, or $125 billion, of government revenue came from oil and gas last year. Europe accounted for around 40% of exports by value, implying a hit to Moscow’s revenues of up to $50 billion, or 15% of last year’s figure. Then, the budget surplus was $7 billion.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterYet higher energy prices will help. While a lack of pipelines makes it hard to reroute gas, oil can be shipped elsewhere. And crude oil and oil products represent three-quarters of Russia’s energy export value. Last year, the average oil price was around $71 per barrel, while today crude trades at around $108. That implies Russia could cut oil exports by roughly a third without losing revenue. And prices would likely rise further after an embargo, offsetting any discount Moscow would need to offer buyers.Of course, an expected 15% GDP decline this year will also hammer revenues, and push up the budget deficit. But Putin’s wartime propaganda efforts will help. The Kremlin has used pro-government media to prime the population for tough times, giving it a freer hand to reduce expenditures such as $20 billion spent on healthcare last year, while ringfencing the $49 billion defence budget. Putin could allow the rouble to depreciate read more . That would boost rouble revenue generated by exports.Lastly, Putin still has around $160 billion of reserves that are unhampered by Western sanctions, once you subtract around $140 billion in gold which Washington is trying to stop being monetised read more . Dipping into those and around $50 billion  read more  in budget funds he stashed away could buy time until more exports can be redirected, say to India or China.An energy embargo would hurt Russia, but may not cripple Putin.

62,4/11/2022,SocGen avoids the worst in costly Russian exit,"Leo Tolstoy wrote that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. The same applies to banks in Russia. Société Générale (SOGN.PA) has managed to ease its painful exit from the country by selling Rosbank (ROSB.MM) back to oligarch Vladimir Potanin, the man it bought the unit from. The terms of its departure are better than those envisioned under the worst-case scenario described last month by the French bank. But they still mark the end of a long and sad story.The bank run by Frédéric Oudéa said on Monday it’s writing off a total of 3.1 billion euros as a result of its Russian exit. That consists of a 2 billion euro hit on Rosbank’s book value and 1.1 billion euros SocGen described as the reversal of a rouble conversion reserve. But it will also collect a payment, including some 500 million euros of subordinated debt that the parent bank had extended to its Russian subsidiary.SocGen says the deal will shrink its common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio by 20 basis points, from 13.7% at the end of last year. That’s significantly better than the 50 basis point hit it would have suffered if its Russian assets had been expropriated. At the end of December, SocGen had 49.8 billion euros of CET1 capital and risk-weighted assets of 363 billion euros. The implication is that selling Rosbank to Potanin’s Interros leaves SocGen slightly more than 1 billion euros better off.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAccording to Interros, the terms of the transaction have been approved by the Kremlin, which should allow the French lender to avoid the fate of the Western companies in Russia threatened with expropriation by President Vladimir Putin. Assuming other authorities do not intervene, SocGen will have managed the closest thing to an orderly exit. Little wonder its shares jumped as much as 7% on Monday morning.Yet Rosbank never delivered on the promise of fast growth envisioned by the French bank’s leaders in 2006. SocGen bought a stake months after the assassination of the Russian central banker tasked with cleaning up the crime-riddled banking sector. It took majority control in early 2008, just a few months before the global financial crisis. It fired Rosbank’s chief executive for corruption in 2013.

63,4/19/2022,IMF’s search for Ukraine help should start at home,"The International Monetary Fund’s response to the Ukraine crisis is wanting. The Washington-based lender describes at length, in its latest report, the lasting damages that Russia’s war on Ukraine will inflict on the world economy and exhorts governments to mount a coordinated response. Its call to action, however, should begin at home.The fund’s report on Tuesday lays bare the severe fallout from the Ukraine war. The global economy will only grow by 3.6% this year, 0.8 percentage points below the previous forecast. Inflation will be much higher for longer. Yet nearly two months after the invasion, the IMF has allocated just $1.4 billion of its “rapid financial instruments” to Ukraine, and set up a special account to receive funds from donors to help the country’s reconstruction. That falls way short of the current needs of a country whose economy, the fund reckons, will shrink by 35% this year.According to the IMF, Ukraine will lose the equivalent of nearly 9% of GDP in tax revenue this year – and that can only be considered a conservative estimate. Based on last year’s GDP, that would translate into a loss of fiscal receipts of nearly $16 billion. Put differently: the IMF’s help so far amounts to barely more than a month of lost tax revenue for the Kyiv government.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterTrue, the IMF was created to help countries with balance of payment problems design sound economic policies. That narrow focus and cumbersome structure means it cannot act as a “financial firefighter” in bigger crises like the Covid-19 pandemic or the current war, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointed out last week.But, as the world’s lender of last resort, the IMF should be doing more to help Ukraine meet its obligations. Kyiv still has to pay for the teachers, policemen, not to mention soldiers needed to keep the country going. And the fund should be playing a leading role in shaping the international response, by convincing its shareholder governments that Ukraine needs massive help now.The IMF’s weak response will reinforce critics, like Yellen, who are beginning to wonder if its governance is the bigger problem.

Yet one thing looks the same as when Culp started: GE’s market capitalization, which on Monday was $99 billion. He is delivering what he can, but investors seem to be losing patience with things outside of his control.GE gave some good news on Tuesday.

Healthcare revenue growth of 2% would have been 9% if it weren't for trouble getting hold of electronics, Covid-19-related delays to hospitals' plans to deploy GE kit, and scarce construction materials. The renewable energy business didn’t hit its potential because of, among other things, uncertainty surrounding political support for green energy incentives.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe problem is, unforeseen headwinds are becoming a constant in Culp’s time as GE’s leader, and it’s weighing on the shares, which fell more than 9% on Tuesday.

The GE chief reckons he can still deliver the $7 billion of free cash flow previously targeted for 2023, suggesting today's problems won't be tomorrow's.

65,4/27/2022,Putin’s gas shock is acid test of EU unity,"Vladimir Putin has crossed the Rubicon. In cutting off gas to Poland and Bulgaria, the Russian president is forcing other countries to choose whether to bow to his demands for payment in roubles, or accept a damaging energy embargo. It shoves the European Union towards a critical test of its unity.Ever since Putin invaded Ukraine, Russia has continued to export the annual equivalent of around 100 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe, while the West has shied away from sanctioning energy imports. It’s obvious why. Russian gas sales last year were $54 billion. The EU, meanwhile, relies on Russia for well over a third of its annual gas supply.In some ways, the EU’s next step should be obvious. Bulgaria relies on Russia for 100% of its gas, and Putin’s resolve to make good on his threat to cut off states that don’t pay in roubles – which some fear is a way to circumvent those sanctions that do exist – suggests other states could be next. If the EU responded by rejecting Putin’s demands, it would end an absurd situation where the West is funding Putin’s war. The bloc has already laid out a path to cutting Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year  read more .Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterPutin knows things are far from that simple. Poland is under 50% reliant on Russian gas with storage facilities that are 75% full, and its gas contract expires soon anyway. But the equivalent storage level for the EU is only 32%, according to AGSI. Getting that to the 80% level it needs to be at by this autumn would cost 50 billion euros, according to Breakingviews calculations, and require 50 bcm of U.S. liquefied natural gas to head to Europe. European consumers might need to cut gas usage by over 15%, according to Rystad Energy.European big beasts like German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose country relies on Moscow for over half its gas, may be tempted to muddle through. Uniper (UN01.DE), a German utility, reckons Putin’s rouble edict can be negotiated without breaking sanctions, and some large companies are already paying in the Russian currency, Bloomberg says. Much harder would be to coordinate an EU-wide response, involving energy rations and a common fund to help states hardest hit.

67,5/12/2022,India heatwave throws food security for loop,"Scorching temperatures in India are adding to the world’s food security headache. After a brief respite, the country’s weeks-long climate change-induced heatwave returned this week, with the mercury hitting 46 degrees Celsius. It raises the risk of death by heatstroke for swathes of the population and reduces the hours people can safely work. It’s also singeing cropland, fuelling doubts about whether New Delhi will maintain its newfound role exporting wheat to help fill global grain stores from Egypt to Bangladesh depleted by the war in Ukraine.India is one of the world's biggest wheat producers, but typically sells very little abroad. That changed as tensions mounted between Ukraine and Russia, which account for 28% of global exports  read more . Selling some of India’s surplus supplies was widely seen as a neat solution to easing a global grain shortage; It also helped mute criticism in Washington about New Delhi ramping up cheap oil purchases from Moscow. As a result, India’s wheat exports grew almost six-fold year-on-year in April to 1.4 million tonnes and officials expected them to continue to rise.That was welcome news, not least because worsening water scarcity in large parts of Brazil, the United States and Europe has sapped supplies there, leaving India as the only major supplier of wheat at present  read more . But the country’s ability and willingness to step up is suddenly less certain with the country sizzling. Falling yields of the crop and rising exports have sent the monthly retail average price of wheat flour to a 12-year high, with overall food inflation at 7.7% in March. Rupee depreciation, meanwhile, is raising the cost of crucial imports, including edible oil.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterTo ease the pain, India’s government is reducing the wheat component of its vast food subsidy scheme that feeds some 800 million people as part of its pandemic response. India has so far held back from imposing export controls but protecting consumers at the expense of farmers has been the government’s fallback strategy to tame inflation in the past. Any restrictions also would reduce the incentive for farmers to produce in the first place, hurting India’s wider ambitions to sell more overseas.

68,5/12/2022,Emerging markets offer dubious investment appeal,"U.S. stock markets are tumbling but shares from developing economies have fallen just as fast. Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 Index of big U.S. companies is down about 17%; the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has dropped 18%. This basket of stocks, containing shares in companies from Brazil to the United Arab Emirates, now looks relatively good value. Investors who bought these equities when they were cheap at the turn of the century enjoyed excellent returns. Unfortunately, China’s increasing weight suggests that happy experience won’t be repeated.In the early 1980s the Dutch economist Antoine van Agtmael wanted to launch a “Third World Investment Fund” but was told the name wasn’t catchy enough. So he came up with the more upbeat “emerging markets”. In 1985, the first index tracking these stocks was launched. A couple of years later, MSCI created its own benchmark. Fund managers promoted the new asset class with the promise that higher rates of economic growth across the developing world would be accompanied by superior equity returns. In 2001, Goldman Sachs forecast that the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRICs) would overtake the developed world within decades. Van Agtmael hailed the “Emerging Markets Century”.The problem with this idea is that there is no correlation between economic growth and equity returns. In theory, in a world with free capital flows, shareholder returns from different stock markets should converge. Historic data from various countries since 1900 confirms that investors have not done better by picking markets with the highest economic growth.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterIn fact, the opposite has been the case. In the short run, countries with the fastest GDP growth have tended to deliver the lowest returns, while economic laggards have done best. Look at China’s recent experience. In the last three decades China’s GDP has grown more than 30-fold in U.S. dollars. Yet over this period the total return on Chinese equities has averaged just over 2% a year, again in dollar terms.Van Agtmael was on firmer ground when he argued that investing in emerging markets would diversify portfolios, thereby lowering risk and enhancing returns. According to MSCI, the trailing one-year correlation between emerging and developed markets is around 0.4, a little below its long-term average. Markets that move in perfect unison would have a correlation of 1. Adding emerging stocks to investment portfolios has paid off. Since the turn of the century, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has marginally outperformed the MSCI World benchmark of developed markets.The trouble is that emerging markets are no longer as diverse as they used to be. China, which wasn’t part of van Agtmael’s original index, now accounts for around 30% of the MSCI benchmark. Thus future investment returns from emerging markets now largely hinge upon what happens in the People’s Republic.There are grounds for pessimism on this front. Investors only thrive in countries where the rule of law holds sway. Yet shareholder rights count for little in modern China. Last year, in the name of “common prosperity”, President Xi Jinping went after Chinese education companies, real estate firms and tech giants. The president’s taste for absolute control has been reflected in China’s zero-Covid policy, which has recently resulted in a new round of rolling lockdowns and economic disruption across the country.To some extent these risks are reflected in current valuations for emerging market equities, which trade at a significant discount to Western stocks. But investment strategist John-Paul Smith, who started running an emerging markets fund in 2001, suggests that that the opportunities on offer today are not as compelling as two decades ago. At the time my former employer, the asset manager GMO, forecast that emerging market equities would deliver annual real returns of nearly 8% over the coming years. That prediction turned out to be remarkably accurate. GMO’s most recent forecast is for emerging markets to return just half that amount.What made emerging market stocks such a good bet at the turn of the century, says Smith, is that the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s propelled a number of macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms. Governments were forced to rein in public spending. Banking regulations improved and bankruptcy rules were more strictly enforced, driving the weakest firms to the wall. Emerging markets appeared to be embracing the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism. Over the past decade, however, they have moved in the opposite direction. State capitalism, says Smith, is the kiss of death for investors. Creative destruction is not a policy option.What should investors do? Smith believes the concept of emerging markets as a separate asset class is outdated. In his view, it was always a marketing device to draw investors into funds that charged higher fees. He suggests that emerging market investments should be folded into global equity portfolios. At the very least, they should be renamed “less developed markets” to alert investors to their generally weak governance and lack of liquidity.Russia’s recent exit from the Western financial system shows that emerging market investors face the occasional prospect of a complete wipe-out. This was not a one-off. Russian shareholders lost everything in the revolution of 1917, as did Chinese shareholders when the Communists took power in 1949. Japan’s stock market fell 98% in real terms during World War Two. A study by Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School shows that investors in emerging markets never recovered from these devastating losses.At the time of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian equities accounted for around 2% of the emerging markets index. Such a loss can be easily absorbed. But China’s weighting in the benchmark is 15 times greater. Given rising political tension, foreign investors cannot completely ignore the risk that they will lose their shirts in China.Some emerging market investors are therefore choosing to take China out of the picture. The Emerging Markets ex-China Index is a more balanced portfolio with less geopolitical risk but without any apparent sacrifice of prospective returns. In the investment world that’s called a no-brainer.Follow @Breakingviews on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

69,5/17/2022,Using Russian assets in Ukraine would be a mistake,"Western powers have frozen about $300 billion of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves. Rebuilding Ukraine after the war could cost at least as much. So the idea that the United States and Europe should confiscate the assets and use them to help finance the gigantic task has a symmetrical financial appeal. It would also provide moral comfort by making the country responsible for the destruction pay for the reconstruction. But it would also be the wrong way to hold Russia to account.Assuming the overall composition of Russian reserves hasn’t changed much since June last year, France, Germany and the United Kingdom now control the equivalent of about $155 billion, with another $39 billion on hold in the United States.From a legal standpoint, seizing the assets held at the Russian central bank is more complicated than freezing them. Yet even if governments can find a workaround – for example, by passing new laws – confiscation would be wrong-headed.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterTo begin with, the move would deprive Western powers of a key source of leverage over Russia when negotiating a truce, because they could no longer offer to unfreeze the assets. Indeed, the permanent loss of the reserves could even push President Vladimir Putin into more desperate and aggressive acts.Once seized, the reserves would also be open to claims from individuals or organisations alleging they have been wronged by Moscow. Think of private creditors who might suffer losses following a Russian sovereign default.Finally, confiscating the reserves would imply that Europe and the United States have given up hope of a future Russia ever rejoining the international system. If a more Western-friendly regime were to emerge, it would ask for a return of at least part of the money. That would leave U.S. and Western taxpayers on the hook.The best way to rebuild Ukraine is for governments and international organisations to start thinking about the complex international and financial strategy that will allow them to begin the task once the war is over. Not to daydream about confiscating Russian reserves.Follow @pierrebri on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- German Finance Minister Christian Lindner is “politically open to the idea of seizing foreign assets of the Russian Central Bank” to help finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, he said in an interview with European newspapers published on May 17.- Lindner added that the idea was currently being discussed among European Union members and within the G7 group of industrialised nations.- Confiscating the Russian central bank’s foreign currency reserves, which have been frozen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is an idea that the International Monetary Fund will also “study carefully”, IMF Deputy Director Gita Gopinath told the Financial Times on May 17.- Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, told the FT on May 9 that European governments should start thinking about using the reserves to rebuild Ukraine.- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko later told reporters such a move would amount to “the destruction of the mere foundation of international relations.”- Kyrylo Shevchenko, the governor of Ukraine’s central bank, told the BBC in April that a large share of the “huge” financial package needed to rebuild Ukraine “needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor.”(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

70,5/20/2022,Ukraine’s spare energy can help itself and Europe,"Ukraine has an in-built weapon against the destruction wrought by conflict. With 55 gigawatts (GW) of installed power capacity, the war-torn nation can produce more electricity than it currently needs. That presents an opportunity for both Kyiv and the energy-starved European Union.Fearing that Moscow might use energy as a weapon, Ukraine has since 2017 been working to extricate itself from the Russian power grid. Vladimir Putin’s invasion unsurprisingly accelerated that transition. On March 16 Ukraine became fully synchronised with the EU’s energy network.This creates an attractive imbalance. Ukraine’s energy demand has halved since the conflict, and it is unlikely to go back to full capacity even with a ceasefire. The opportunity is for the country to export excess electricity to its EU neighbours, and use the proceeds to speed up its costly reconstruction. Exporting 1 GW of electricity could bring Ukraine 1 billion euros per year, energy traders say.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe EU, meanwhile, may be interested in importing carbon-free energy produced by Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors, which can generate around 14 GW when running at full tilt. Countries like the Baltic republics are still connected to the Russian grid, so they need alternative electricity to cut their Moscow ties. The EU is also desperately seeking to diversify away from Russian gas.The catch is the power lines that connect Ukraine to the likes of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Right now, they are few and far between. Ukraine’s cross-border export capacity is a paltry 700 megawatts (MW). And the country only exports about 200 MW to Poland, Petro Kotin, chief executive of Ukraine’s nuclear power operator Energoatom, told Breakingviews.That can be fixed with investments. Reactivating a Soviet-era power line through Poland would cost about $30 million, Kotin says. Building new lines from scratch requires $500 million per line. Ukraine clearly does not have the money. Neighbours like Poland are sceptical, and private investors are balking at the idea of venturing into a conflict area. That leaves funding from multilateral organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank or the European Commission.Helping Ukraine bolster electricity exports would support its economy and alleviate Europe’s energy headache.Follow @LJucca on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- The European Union on May 18 fleshed out its strategy to diversify energy supplies to reduce its dependency on Russian imports.- The EU and Ukraine linked their electricity grids on March 16.

71,5/26/2022,Global stability partly hangs on Saudi reinvention,"Saudi Arabia’s attempts at reinvention are in full view at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It has branded multiple cafés on the main drag, including one bearing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s name. As war in Ukraine gives the oil-rich nation even greater clout, it has an opportunity to realign itself politically. There’s far more work to do beyond serving coffee to the global elite.The kingdom’s economy is projected to expand 8% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, far outpacing the Western world, some of which is bracing for recession. A big reason is the 20%-plus growth in the energy sector in the first quarter, per FocusEconomics. The chief executive of state oil giant Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), Amin Nasser, said that he has plans to spend as much as $50 billion on projects that promote long-term demand for energy. Saudi is teeing up a situation where its current oil power will only grow.At the same time, U.S. producers are somewhat hamstrung by a presidential administration resistant to making life easier for drillers. Speaking at the same forum on Tuesday, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry acknowledged the need for oil and gas but cautioned against ramping up investments.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAs a leader in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a big holder of unpumped capacity, Saudi holds sway over much of the supply of a commodity the world desperately needs to cushion the effects of war. The kingdom has loosened laws – like those that allow women to drive – and is hoping to increase its tourism business. But it wasn’t that long ago that global leaders, including Germany’s former Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, were condemning the nation after the killing of reporter Jamal Khashoggi.At his regular Davos dinner, philanthropist George Soros noted that so-called “closed societies”, or ones where citizens serve rulers, are in ascent while “open societies” – those where the state protects the individual – are receding. Soros said China and Russia present the greatest threat to open society, and just a few years ago he might have put Saudi in that group too. The pressure to take sides is rising as the world becomes more divided.

72,5/26/2022,How sanctions against Russia could backfire,"Since President Vladimir Putin’s ill-fated invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been expelled from the Western financial system and punished with a variety of international economic and financial penalties. Addressing the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “maximum” sanctions so that Russia “clearly knows the immediate consequences of their actions”.Policymakers often view such measures as a relatively quick and painless way for law-abiding nations to punish transgressors. But history shows their efficacy is doubtful and, at times, they can seriously backfire. Besides, if there’s one country that has proven it can withstand sanctions, it’s Russia.According to Nicholas Mulder’s timely new book, “The Economic Weapon”, sanctions were first deployed by Athens, which imposed a commercial ban against the Greek port city of Megara in 432 BC. But their use only took off during World War One, when Britain and France constructed an extensive economic blockade against Germany and its allies. After the war, sanctions were seen as a tool to keep nations at peace. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson believed the threat was “an absolute isolation … that brings a nation to its senses”.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe League of Nations was created in 1920 with the power to impose sanctions on countries that broke international law. In its early years, there were a couple of successes: potential incursions by Greece and Yugoslavia into neighbouring states were halted by the League’s threat to shut off their external trade. The real test came in 1935 when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini invaded Ethiopia. All but six of the League’s 58 members deployed sanctions against Italy. They throttled exports in order to reduce the country’s access to foreign exchange reserves and limit its capacity to wage war. Yet after several months of fighting, Mussolini’s army entered Addis Ababa and the sanctions were lifted.There are several lessons to be learnt from this failure. First, economic weapons are less effective when deployed against large states. Second, the early advocates of sanctions, such as Wilson, had a naïve view of human nature. They believed that populations would desist from aggressive actions when their material interests are threatened. The unfortunate truth is that nations and their rulers, especially autocratic ones, sometimes have other priorities. Third, incomplete economic blockades are ineffective. Both the United States and Germany remained neutral during the Italo-Abyssinian War and the League failed to cut off Italy’s oil supplies.Mussolini’s isolation on the world stage pushed him into Hitler’s arms. Germany and Japan, fearing that the economic weapon would next be deployed against them, accelerated their search for self-sufficiency in raw materials. In Germany’s case, this meant pushing further into Central Europe, annexing Austria in 1938 and the whole of Czechoslovakia the following year. Hitler even told a foreign diplomat in 1939 that he needed Ukraine so that Germans would never be starved again. Japan’s desperate need for oil eventually brought it into conflict with the United States. Thus, the sanctions against Italy hastened the onset of World War Two.Now Putin’s Russia is the international outcast. Unlike Italy, the country’s abundant natural resources make it extraordinarily resilient to external economic pressure. In fact, sanctions were first used against Russia after the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 in what Mulder calls a form of “counter-revolution on the cheap”. The new regime withstood this economic siege and even used its monopoly on trade to withhold commodities from Europe, just as Russia today is keeping Ukrainian wheat from reaching foreign markets. By the early 1930s, when the Soviets ceased almost all trade with the outside world, Russia’s autarky was complete.International opposition to Putin is also far from unanimous. According to international trade expert Simon Evenett, for every country sanctioning Russia there are three that are not, among them China and India. Roughly half of Russia’s exports go to these countries, whose export share has risen sharply over the past decade. Furthermore, Europe remains dependent on Russian energy. Over the past three months, Russian imports have fallen faster than exports, producing a record trade surplus. Even though Western countries have seized Russia’s currency reserves, the rouble has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Evenett calculates that a European ban on imports of Russian energy would permanently lower its GDP by just 1%.At the start of World War One, Russia accounted for around a quarter of French overseas investments. President Georges Clemenceau imposed sanctions in a forlorn attempt to get the Bolsheviks to honour obligations agreed by the previous Tsarist regime. Times have changed. Washington is now actively forcing a Russian default by forbidding Western banks from receiving payments from Moscow. Russian stocks and bonds owned by foreigners have been marked down to zero. Multinational companies including McDonald\'s (MCD.N), Renault (RENA.PA), British American Tobacco (BATS.L), Heineken (HEIN.AS) and BP (BP.L) are selling their Russian operations at fire-sale prices.It\'s hard to see how writing off hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investments in Russia will persuade Putin to change his behaviour. Still, these remarkable events highlight another unwelcome feature of sanctions: they remove traditional legal protections afforded to private property, exposing investors to arbitrary state depredations. Early critics of economic restrictions had an even more worrying concern. Sanctions, they said, blur the line between the state of war and that of peace. It’s not clear at what point a sanctioned nation will consider an extra punishment to be an act of war. Billionaire investor George Soros told the Davos audience this week that, in his view, World War Three was already under way.The longer-term danger is that the invasion of Ukraine and the accompanying Russian sanctions, like those imposed on Italy in the mid-1930s, will provide a further impetus to deglobalisation, driving Russia into China’s camp and upending the U.S. dollar-based financial system. Evenett warns that the advent of a multipolar world could result in yet more stranded assets for Western investors. This is not a desirable outcome, but a chain of events has been set in motion that may make it unavoidable.Follow @Breakingviews on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

73,5/27/2022,Fingers crossed Davos Man gets it wrong again,"Three things were in shorter supply than usual at this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos: snow, delegates, and reasons to be cheerful. The confab of politicians, financiers, business leaders and hangers-on reconvened in the Swiss mountain resort after a pandemic-induced absence of more than two years. The consensus that emerged is that the world is beset by problems, many of which are going to get worse. The best hope is that the unreliable prognosticator known as “Davos Man” has got it wrong once again.It wasn’t just the lack of icy pavements and glitzy parties or the free seats in the normally crowded conference centre that distinguished this year’s gathering from the usual late-January schmooze-fest. Attendees also noted a pervasive economic and political gloom. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth month, has tipped the world into a myriad of crises.Top of mind are soaring energy costs. Europe is trying to wean itself off Russian oil and gas, urged on by Ukrainian politicians who fanned out across Davos to press the case for a full embargo. But alternative sources are scarce. Western banks are sticking to their commitments to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, making it “very hard to finance any new” fossil fuel projects, one senior European banker noted. Officials from Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), the world’s largest oil company, warned of a shortage of supply of the commodity.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe steep rise in oil prices is adding to a severe shortage of food. The global farming community cannot replace the wheat that normally comes from the fields of both Russia and Ukraine. Heavy importers like Egypt and Tunisia may struggle to put food on the table. David Beasley, executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme, said hundreds of millions of people were “marching to starvation”. Political instability is likely to follow.Then there are the lingering effects of Covid-19. Though only a handful of Davos delegates sported face masks, many fretted about the new round of harsh lockdowns in China, which have depressed growth in the world’s second-largest economy and further disrupted supply chains. Multinationals are seeking backup suppliers in places like southeast Asia, or bringing production closer to home. Meanwhile, governments are reviewing their dependence on imports of energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. As companies duplicate manufacturing facilities and hold higher inventories, margins will be squeezed.China is also causing consternation for other reasons. As the conference kicked off, U.S. President Joe Biden - who chose to visit Asia rather than Switzerland – said he was willing to use force to defend Taiwan. That raised the prospect of the West deploying sweeping sanctions against the People’s Republic. It’s one of the few areas of agreement among U.S. political leaders now bickering about gun control after yet another shooting in an American elementary school. But one senior European banker warned that imposing Russian-style sanctions on China would be so disastrous for both sides that it amounted to an economic form of the “mutually assured destruction” of the Cold War.Investment bankers can typically find a reason to see the glass as half full. Not this year. The S&P 500 Index is flirting with a bear-market decline of 20%, while many large technology stocks have halved in value. This has brought the market for equity offerings to a screeching halt. Bankers underwriting debt issues and advising on mergers and acquisitions are also likely to be less busy after a record-breaking 2021. Valuations of venture capital-backed startups, tens of thousands of which raised money last year, are under pressure. “Half of them are not going to make it,” said one investor.Yet even as Gita Gopinath, the International Monetary Fund’s No. 2, told a Davos audience of “downside risks” to the fund’s 3.6% forecast for global GDP growth this year, other companies suggested their businesses were still holding up. Take $5 billion global staffing company ManpowerGroup (MAN.N), which helps to manage temporary workers who are often a leading indicator for the broader workforce. “We’re not yet seeing any sign of labour markets having any difficulty in this environment,” Chief Executive Jonas Prising said.It’s also worth remembering that prevailing opinions formed at Davos have an unerring knack of being wide of the mark. In 2017, delegates hailed Chinese President Xi Jinping as a champion of globalisation. A year later, Western bankers and businessmen praised Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic and social reforms. Months later, Saudi agents murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. And in January 2020 the Davos crowd was preoccupied with the risks posed by climate change, not the pandemic which closed down large parts of the world economy a few weeks later.A similar forecasting error this year could even be good news for the planet. Ukraine and Russia might agree to a truce, leading to the partial lifting of sanctions and easing of the pressure on energy and food prices. China may find a way to live with Covid-19. Inflation could recede, allowing central banks to push through fewer increases in interest rates. Economic growth could pick up, and financial markets recover. As they headed home, global leaders received the news that the World Economic Forum will reconvene in January 2023. It will be less than eight months before “Davos Man” finds out whether he got it wrong again.Follow @peter_tl and @thereallsl on Twitter(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists.

74,1/24/2022,Britain is right to stand up to Vladmir Putin and defend Ukraine’s grateful citizens,"REMEMBER how we were told the EU had kept the peace in Europe for 60 years? It was always a lie — and is looking more offensive by the day. Here’s another one the Brexit-haters told: That leaving the EU would render Britain impotent and globally irrelevant. They were even at it yesterday, despite the facts staring them in the face. Who knows how the Russia-Ukraine standoff will pan out? What we DO know, what sovereign Ukraine’s grateful citizens know, is that Brexit Britain flew in weapons to help defend them against invasion. We have been far more active over their plight than anyone — militarily, legally and diplomatically. And we are right, with the US, to stand up to Putin. Germany shamefully bottled out to protect its Russian gas supplies. The EU is a rabbit frozen in the headlights. We can only worry for those europhiles who, seeing all this, choose not to stay discreetly silent but to argue that black is white and up is down. To still doggedly claim that Britain is increasingly insignificant, based on idiotic columns they comfort-read in Brexit-loathing papers, is a form of madness. NO publisher could get away with furthering the hate, extremism, dangerous ignorance and incitements to violence that social media spews out. For all of the excuses offered up by Twitter and the rest, the tech giants publish harmful filth every day. So we welcome them facing UK legal action, including now the targeting of executives who fail to protect the public. The tech firms have brought significant benefits to the world. But they have caused grotesque damage too. It is time they spent their vast riches eradicating it. The Government’s so-called “Nick Clegg law”, after the ex-Deputy PM who now spins for Facebook, is \xadwelcome. But this cannot be mere sabre-rattling. Downing Street MUST see this through. WE doubt there is a better illustration of Home Office impotence over illegal migrants than its failure over suicide bomber Emad al-Swealmeen. He is now confirmed to have told a pack of lies over his background before his asylum claim was thrown out in 2015. He should have been flown under guard that very day to his birth country Iraq, or Jordan, where his passport was issued. Instead he stayed for years, appealing repeatedly to stall his exit. Then he blew himself up at a hospital. For all that it moans about left-wing lawyers representing asylum cheats, this is still a disaster for the Home Office. Its inability to deport those with no right to be here — along with the armada of boats bringing more in every day — render our border controls meaningless.","Emad al-Swealmeen, Putin",sun_news
75,3/17/2022,EU countries supplying Russia weapons isn’t just jaw-droppingly complacent – it’s insane,"NOT for the first time, Ukraine’s brave President Zelensky hits the nail on the head. “All you cared about was the economy,” he bluntly told German MPs \xadyesterday, berating them for doing next to nothing when Putin was massing tanks on his borders in early February. But that holds true for the other major EU nations too, going right back to 2015. Because Germany, France and Italy sold vast and lucrative quantities of weapons to Russia, dodging an arms embargo established in 2014. Ten EU countries were involved, raking in \xadhundreds of millions of euros. It is bad enough that the Brussels club’s heavy and deliberate dependence on Russian energy is even now keeping the Kremlin war machine afloat. But we now know that Ukrainians are being massacred and terrorised with weapons supplied by EU nations: Bombs from Paris, guns from Berlin, armoured cars from Rome. Britain’s hands are not spotless either.  We too seem to have supplied Moscow, albeit on a far smaller scale.  The Government insists no military export licences were granted after 2014. But, as with the EU, old contracts WERE fulfilled. Given Putin’s crimes — from Syria to Crimea to the Salisbury poisonings — this wasn’t just jaw-droppingly complacent on the part of Europe’s leaders. It was insane. IT is grim, even as Ukraine burns, to hear speculation already about when and how Russian sanctions might be lifted. They must NEVER be relaxed while Putin and his lackeys remain in power. Unprovoked, these evil men ignited a catastrophic war to steal a neighbouring country . . . mass-murdering its innocent citizens and levelling its cities. Each day they look more likely to fail. But the horror is already far too great to be forgiven until Russia is under brand new leadership.  Many thousands are dead, three million Ukrainians are refugees, the global economy is reeling and Russia is isolated and broken. We sympathise with its citizens, most of them sadly still swallowing Kremlin lies, for the suffering they must now endure. But until the smirking war criminal and his grotesque henchmen are jailed or dead it would be an obscenity for anything like normal relations to resume. WE’RE not keen on a total ban on MPs’ second jobs. But there should be limits. Indeed the Government appeared to back a ceiling on pay or hours during the scandal last year over Geoffrey Cox’s vast earnings as a QC. \n Now it’s quietly U-turned. It reckons either limit would be “impractical”. Inconvenient, more like . . . to those Tory MPs who consider an MP’s £82,000-a year salary a pittance.

76,3/21/2022,"Nato must back Ukraine unwaveringly with our words, sanctions and weapons","THE West must not give Putin an inch, any more than the Allies did Hitler. That means backing Ukraine’s President Zelensky all the way in his refusal to surrender — and giving him every tool to defeat this heinous enemy. Joe Biden has little appetite for foreign conflicts, as he showed long ago over Vietnam and with his shambolic retreat from Afghanistan last year. But it would be folly for Nato to be thinking already, or at all, of pressurising Zelensky into ending the war by handing Putin some form of victory. To hell with that.  For Ukraine to offer anything beyond its promise not to join Nato, which is not on the cards anyway, would reward the monster for genocide. For all our sakes it must not happen. Putin must be defeated, then ousted. The theory that he needs an “exit ramp”, a way to back off but retain credibility at home, is flawed. He has no PR problem in Russia, no need to “sell” a victory.  Despite our punishing sanctions, most still swallow whatever Putin tells them, such is his stranglehold on the media there. Russians dismiss as bogus the video proof of slaughtered civilians sent to them by distressed Ukrainian friends. They even accept the absurd lie that the apocalyptic levelling of Mariupol is the work of mythical Ukrainian Nazis. Putin could tell them anything.  Only Russia’s defeated soldiers returning home with the truth might change that. Zelensky has huge charisma, courage and leadership qualities.  He, not the West, must determine Ukraine’s fate. Nato must back him unwaveringly. With our words, sanctions and weapons. FEW would envy a Chancellor tasked with balancing the books after borrowing a staggering £400billion during Covid. In turn Rishi Sunak needs to grasp the appalling pressures on low-paid Sun readers hammered by rocketing bills.  He can read their experiences opposite. At tomorrow’s crucial mini-Budget Mr Sunak must cut fuel duty by at least 5p a litre.  That will make some difference, but not enough.  The Sun would also like VAT and green levies slashed on energy. And we again urge the Chancellor to rethink whether the worst economic squeeze in a generation is the right moment to raise National Insurance. It isn’t, of course.  But if Downing Street insists it cannot be avoided, Mr Sunak can at least tweak income thresholds to spare the lowest-paid. Don’t let us down, Rishi. THE energy bill’s landed at Brenda McCossick’s three-bed house. Electric’s not bad: £16.17 for March so far.  \n Gas is a bit more, at almost £2billion. We didn’t think the price cap went up until April.","Rishi, Joe Biden, Putin, Brenda McCossick’s, Hitler, Zelensky",sun_news
77,3/22/2022,Putin used the post-Soviet era to gorge himself on his nation’s oil wealth,"FOR decades Russia has been ruled by murderous gangsters and thieves. How else could Putin come to own the world’s priciest yacht? He has used the post-Soviet era to gorge himself on his nation’s oil and gas wealth, even more greedily than the oligarchs who suck up to him. Bizarrely, most Russians don’t seem to mind, any more than they do his deranged war. Not yet, anyway. Of course the Scheherazade isn’t in Putin’s name. There’s a shell company on the paperwork, the same sort of legal ruse keeping his pal Alisher Usmanov’s UK mansions out of Britain’s grasp. But it is a monstrous floating palace, fit for a monster. A judo-loving monster. Italy should seize it without delay and fill it with refugees.  Or sell it and hand the cash to Ukrainian charities. If neither is possible, blow it to smithereens. Putin can hardly complain. INSIDE the bubble of Boris-hating Remainiac malcontents, Britain is derided 24/7. They say we’re a backwater who destroyed our own EU-based significance and now “have no credibility around the world”. They’re welcome to their misery. But on Planet Earth the opposite is true.We led the world on jabs and emerged first from Covid’s deadliest stages. Our efforts for Ukrainians have earned us a new place in their hearts. And although we have already signed or reaffirmed scores of trade deals since Brexit, bigger ones now look imminent. International Trade chief Anne-Marie Trevelyan begins talks with Canada today to vastly improve our EU-era agreement. Israel, Mexico and the giants of India and the US are queuing up to do likewise. Putin has unwittingly reminded democracies who their real friends are. “The rest of the world thinks the UK is amazing and wants to work with a trusted partner,” says Mrs Trevelyan. ""We do ourselves down.” Not quite true, Anne-Marie. “We” don’t. UNDER two dismal commissioners the Met Police was allowed to fester and rot. The watchdog’s report into its efforts to eradicate corruption is shocking. Not least because those efforts barely exist. We knew the London force’s vetting procedures were broken, given that it recruited Sarah Everard’s killer Wayne Couzens. We now know a staggering 350 staff have criminal convictions and are still not monitored effectively. Hundreds of valuable crime exhibits are missing — and 2,000 warrant cards.  \n Even more depressingly the inspector finds no appetite among the “arrogant” top brass to learn from failings. What an indictment of Cressida Dick and Bernard Hogan-Howe before her. Whoever takes over has a massive task. But they can hardly do worse.","Mrs Trevelyan, Wayne Couzens, Cressida Dick, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Anne-Marie, Boris, Sarah Everard, Putin, Bernard Hogan-Howe",sun_news
78,3/24/2022,Russia must be axed from G20 and ostracised by the international community,"THE Russian war machine, over-hyped and inept, is in disarray.  The last thing Nato, and President Biden especially, should do now is give Putin any concession. The Kremlin monster will get no quarter from Britain, which has led the West’s response, training and arming Ukraine and unveiling punishing sanctions.  It’s no surprise Boris Johnson is considered President Zelensky’s No1 ally and Putin’s No1 Nato foe. And Nato does appear outwardly united that there must be NO pressure on Zelensky to strike a peace deal against his will.  That he alone must be the master of his nation’s destiny. He has certainly earned that right. For once, Joe Biden talked a good game yesterday too. We have to hope he sticks to every word. He has a history of craving hasty exits from foreign conflicts, regardless of the consequences to those left behind.  His White House is reportedly already \xadprivately discussing how Russia might ultimately be rehabilitated. That must not happen while Putin and his evil lackeys remain. Nato must offer Moscow nothing. We must stand behind, and arm, Zelensky.  We must not ease sanctions even if the invaders fully retreat back into Russia. There can be no glimmer of reward or upside from their catastrophic, unprovoked war, their attempted destruction of a peaceful neighbour. Economic punishment must last not just until a ceasefire, or even a full peace deal, but as long as the existing regime is in place . . . grim though that will be for Russia’s people. This pariah nation must be axed from the G20 and ostracised by the international community while its tyrant is still in power.  Resume anything like normal relations and Putin will regroup and try again.  He believes subjugating Ukraine is his destiny. But Nato’s vows to stand firm and united may not be enough. Russian troops have proved adept only at slaughtering unarmed civilians. It is most likely that the mad dog, staring defeat in the face, will try to turn the tide by unleashing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons on the population. Nato will need a more devastating response then. And Russia can forget all about forgiveness, or normality, ever again. IT’S the same old story, the same old \xadrip-off.  Fuel prices go up like a rocket but come down like a feather . . . if at all. When the wholesale cost soars, drivers immediately feel the pain.  But Rishi Sunak cuts fuel duty and half our garages sit tight and keep raking in the inflated takings. \n They were told in writing to act once the reduction came in at 6pm on Wednesday. Too many ignored it. Prices should be at least 5p a litre cheaper. It is simply outrageous that some forecourts are sitting on their hands.

79,3/27/2022,How can we lecture Putin on freedom if we don’t secure it at home?,"WAR in Ukraine has shown that freedom must never be taken for granted. Dominic Raab’s planned laws to protect free speech against the deranged witch-hunts of baying woke mobs are long overdue. For too long cancel culture bigots have ridden roughshod over freedom of expression. At the same time billionaire chums of Vladimir Putin have used big-money British law firms to stifle investigations into their corrupt activities. The Justice Secretary is right to demand that those “with blood on their hands, or dirty money in their pockets” should be exposed. But Mr Raab must also use new legislation to reverse the recent Supreme Court ruling that blocks the identification of people who are arrested. \n This ludicrous judgement is a licence for monsters. It gives villains the chance to hide their wrongdoings behind all-concealing privacy laws. And in a chilling echo of Putin’s police state, it means cops have less scrutiny over who they decide to arrest. How can we lecture Putin on freedom if we don’t secure it at home? A GUARANTEED six-and-a half hour school day is a sensible proposition. Especially as the poorest children have suffered almost two years of disruption and lost lessons during the pandemic. Anyone would see the plan as perfectly reasonable. Anyone that is apart from the boss of a militant teaching union. The left-wing chief of the National Education Union, Kevin Courtney, scoffs: “What will happen in the extra 10 to 15 minutes some pupils will remain in school?” You never know, Mr Courtney. They may actually learn something. IT IS a far cry from her ceremonial Gold State Coach. But the Queen’s new luxury golf buggy is a brilliant idea to help her move around Windsor Castle. It is a stylish and dignified mode of transport which her own mother turned to in later years. \n Her Majesty will probably only use it privately. But if you do see her in it on the M4 please leave plenty of room.","Vladimir Putin, Putin, Queen, Raab, Kevin Courtney, Dominic Raab",sun_news
80,3/28/2022,Russian sanctions must not be lifted even if Putin fully retreats from Ukraine,"EVEN amid the carnage of war, President Zelensky retains a calm and rational grasp of exactly who his friends are. Britain “is definitely on our side”, he says. “It is not performing a balancing act. Britain wants Ukraine to win and Russia to lose.” Compare that with those compromised by their over-reliance on Russian energy and reluctant to commit more weapons or impose more sanctions. Of France and President Macron, \xadZelensky says: “They are afraid of Russia. And that’s it.”  Of Germany: “They are trying to be balanced. They are making a mistake.”  Meanwhile Sleepy Joe Biden had helped Ukraine, he said, but “more slowly than we needed”. Boris Johnson’s Government has been admirably robust.  Yet two Cabinet ministers say sanctions may be lifted if Russia fully retreats and commits to peace. Why? Without provocation it has slaughtered thousands, enslaved 40,000, displaced \xadmillions and annihilated towns and cities to leave them uninhabitable. There are even extraordinary claims that it may have poisoned ceasefire negotiators, including Putin’s ally Roman Abramovich. Why would Russia not now be a global pariah, isolated for a generation, or at least while the current regime remains? And why, given the lies spewing 24/7 from the Kremlin, would we ever trust a word it utters about peace? Have we learned nothing about this criminal tyranny? WHY does Keir Starmer find the penis poser so hard? He insists all trans women, born male but identifying as female, are women.  Given that some have not had surgery to remove their male organ, he is left with only one logical answer: “Yes. Women can have a penis.” Why can’t Labour’s leader just say it, instead of blustering limply on the radio? It’s because he knows that most voters beyond woke millennials in London and our university cities would respond “No, they can’t” — and agree with Boris Johnson that “the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important”. This issue is enraging increasing numbers of women. Starmer needs a definitive answer. So does Boris. Tackle this head-on, gents — it will keep popping up. WILL Smith’s Oscars performance, \xaddispensing instant justice for his wronged wife, was a stinker. True, Chris Rock’s joke was crass and cruel if he knew about Jada’s alopecia. But Will laughed until he saw her face. \n At which point heckling back wasn’t enough for him. He had to be seen, by a global audience, taking violent revenge. It was no example to set, especially to millions of kids who idolise him.","Boris Johnson, Boris, Chris Rock, Putin, WILL Smith, Sleepy Joe Biden, Zelensky",sun_news
81,4/1/2022,Zelensky must face no pressure from the West to offer Putin any significant concession,"SO much for Russia, the supposed military superpower. We were told Putin’s murdering hordes would take Kyiv in three days. Five weeks later they have been put to flight by a Ukrainian resistance so skilled and so heroic the world can only look on in awe. We should believe nothing from the Kremlin, especially now as it reels from the shock of its defeats.  But the notion that its ragged, exhausted, mutinous troops are abandoning President Zelensky’s capital as a goodwill gesture pending peace talks is particularly laughable. So is Moscow’s claim that Ukraine hitting back by bombing a fuel depot in Russia jeopardises those negotiations. Who are they trying to kid? Putin’s fascist invaders have annihilated Ukrainian cities, slaughtered civilians, targeted mums and babies in hospital, raped women in their homes. It is a criminal regime craving victory and territory, not peace.  Even now, who is to say that having withdrawn from Kyiv they won’t flatten it from the air? But Zelensky must face no pressure from the West to offer Putin any significant concession. Forty years ago today Britain too had to face down a foreign invader.  Memories of our heroic troops eventually repelling the Argentinians from the Falklands are still vivid. We gave them nothing. And Britain will stand fully behind Zelensky if he does the same. The US, France and Germany MUST join us, and resist the temptation to hand Putin the slightest gain from his monstrous war in their desperation to stabilise their economies. It is vital for Ukraine, and the free world. THE cost of living disaster may not be the Tories’ fault — but they’re doing themselves no favours. It’s been known for weeks that energy bills would rocket on April 1, quickly followed by council tax and National Insurance. Which genius at Tory HQ thought it was a good idea for the PM and senior ministers to spend the night before hosting a champagne and canapes bash for donors at upmarket Claridge’s? Meanwhile, a minister on £115,000 (following a £2,200 rise yesterday) complains how “tricky” it is for his family to get by.  Did Kit Malthouse not consider how that might sound to those who are genuinely struggling? Sort it out . . . or voters will do it for you. WHAT a group. Leave aside the mad intensity of England or the US vs Iran . . . imagine England v Scotland, or Wales!  Imagine the desperation not to put Ukraine out after all they’ve been through. The Qatar World Cup is brilliant already.","Zelensky, Putin",sun_news
82,4/3/2022,Britain needs to give Zelensky the firepower he needs to crush Putin’s psychopathic invaders,"THE subhuman depravity of Vladimir Putin’s invaders plumbs new depths daily. As his shambolic forces beat a humiliating retreat from the west of Ukraine, the full scale of the slaughter they have left in their wake is emerging. Mass graves. Women gang-raped and murdered. Civilians, including children, tortured, mutilated, tied up then casually executed. Bodies discarded in the street like yesterday’s rubbish, some even booby-trapped with mines. How proud the millions of Russians who back Putin as their strongman must be of “soldiers” whose genocidal atrocities are indistinguishable from those of the Second World War Nazis they once helped to defeat. Some western leaders may mistake Volodymyr Zelensky’s improbable success in turning the bloody tide for an excuse to ease off on sanctions against Moscow and military aid for Kyiv. They would be wiser to follow Boris Johnson’s clarion call to seize the initiative, as all eyes now turn to Ukraine’s east, where the atrocities are thought to be on a still more sickening level. We stand four-square behind the PM in wanting to give Zelensky the firepower he needs — including tanks — to crush Putin’s rabble of psychopathic cut-throats. WITH an energy crisis taking a wrecking ball to household budgets, ministers squabbling over wind turbines is as fruitful as two bald men fighting over a comb. No solution will please everyone, and little in the Government’s much-delayed energy security strategy this week will defuse our cost crisis in the near future. But it is crucial that it puts the UK on course for a diverse and self-sufficient energy supply in the decades ahead. That means renewables, including offshore AND onshore turbines; fracking to exploit our shale gas reserves; and new nuclear power stations uncompromised by foreign ownership. Most importantly, when a direction is set, stick to it, and crack on with it. We find ourselves in the current mess partly because of successive governments’ dithering and lack of will. It is imperative future generations are dealt a better hand. IF quantitative boozing isn’t already a term in economists’ lexicon, it should be now. New figures show beer sales, which nosedived during lockdowns, rebounded last year to almost pre-pandemic levels, with Brits necking an extra 1.1BILLION pints to gladden the hearts of struggling pub landlords up and down the country. And with fewer restrictions this year, along with a World Cup, there’s nothing to stop us boosting the nation’s GDP (Glugged-Down Pints) even further. Rebuilding the economy pint by pint is a tough task\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but someone’s got to do it.","Boris Johnson, Volodymyr Zelensky, Vladimir Putin, Putin, Zelensky",sun_news
83,4/4/2022,Brexit-haters insisting Brussels is doing more than Britain are in denial – ask Zelensky,"THE EU cannot indulge in yet another war of words. There is a real war to be won. The self-obsessed bickering between Poland, France and Germany over their Russia stance is typical of the dysfunctional, endlessly dithering Brussels club. In fairness, Poland has a point. Does President Macron really think he’s negotiating with Putin? It is futile. It smacks of a ruse to delay firmer action. He needs a laser-like focus instead on bringing more economic harm to Russia and on equipping Ukraine’s forces. Germany must wake up too. Yes, it will suffer if it ditches Russian energy. But Europe’s money is funding this pariah regime and its grotesque war crimes. If the EU is the force for good it so often claims, it must stop squabbling and act more ruthlessly against evil. Ukraine’s President Zelensky blames France and Germany for “14 years of concessions” to Putin. But he warmly thanked Boris Johnson for his “historical leadership” over weapons and sanctions. Those Brexit-haters obsessively insisting Brussels is doing more than Britain are in laughable denial. Ask Zelensky. A NATION without a free Press ends up swallowing everything its leader says. It may learn to detest its neighbours. It may dismiss them — as its monstrous President does — as a bogus country whose innocent citizens deserve death. Terrifying numbers in Russia back the psychopathic savages who pass for its army, even as they go door to door executing civilians SS-style. They believe blatant lies and dismiss provable truth. We wish Russia’s poison was confined to the Kremlin. It is not. Putin has whipped traditional nationalism into a murderous, racist frenzy. It is a broken nation, guilty of genocide, at risk of being \xadglobally despised for generations. When a wicked state controls the media, this is where it can end. WHY aren’t pump prices plummeting?

84,4/5/2022,Shambolic Home Office shames Britain and betrays terrified Ukrainian refugees in need of a home,"ARROGANT, complacent, lazy, useless. The Home Office shames Britain before the eyes of the world. Its shambolic failure to green-light more refugees is a betrayal not just of those poor, terrified Ukrainians but of the families who have offered them a home and of Europe’s combined war effort. No one can fault our Government’s commitment to Ukraine’s forces.  But Priti Patel’s department lags woefully behind on those needing our sanctuary. Visa applications take an age to process if they are processed at all. A supposed 24/7 helpline is swamped because just 15 staff are allegedly tasked with handling thousands of calls a day. Distressed men and women still in the war zone are just told they must wait. It is a disgraceful way to handle this emergency, matched for ineptitude only by the Home Office’s simultaneous failure to stop hundreds of illegal migrants arriving daily across the Channel. One of Whitehall’s key departments is broken.  Its civil servants were already disinclined to make anything succeed for a Brexit-backing Tory Government.  Covid was an excuse to work even less. This toxic combination of indolence, intransigence and hapless leadership is blighting lives and letting Britain down. It must be fixed. FRACKING is unpopular, argue Friends of the Earth. The Government says the same.  But the tide may at last be turning. For years eco fanatics sharing conspiracy theories did Putin a favour by turning Britain against extracting our apparently vast quantities of shale gas.  His RT propaganda channel backed them. The industry looked dead. But it’s been reprieved. And a survey reveals it now has 44 per cent support, a majority for lifting the fracking ban. Funny how a cost of living crisis focuses minds. Extinction Rebellion and other face-glueing, nappy-wearing clowns cannot grasp it — but wind and solar will never power Britain alone and new nuclear plants will take a decade.  We need as much cheap gas as possible meantime. Fracking was the answer in the US. It would be insane not to find out if it can be here. THE threat by the tech giants to the future of news outlets is an urgent problem the Government has been too slow to sort. Google and Facebook snaffle 80 per cent of online ad revenue at a crippling cost to news platforms, especially local ones.  While the Tories have set up a Digital Markets Unit to make them pay a fair price for content, it will have no legal powers for the foreseeable. Some publishers are fighting for life. How many must go under before Downing Street legislates to give this watchdog some teeth?","Whitehall, Priti Patel, Putin, Covid",sun_news
85,4/6/2022,EU sanctions on Putin are meaningless while bloc simultaneously bankrolls his genocide,"IT is insane that the EU can slap supposedly punitive new sanctions on Putin while simultaneously bankrolling his genocide. We know past leaders got their economies hooked on Russian energy. But these fresh curbs won’t cripple the madman while gas revenue keeps pouring in. EU nations have bought €35billion of it since the war started, while giving just €1billion in lethal aid to Ukraine.  Their new sanctions, like \xadours, bite only tiny chunks from the Kremlin’s income. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says we are “decimating Putin’s war machine”. Not yet we’re not. Germany and others are so terrified of life without Russian gas they cannot countenance a total ban.  But they must. There are now reports of the industrial slaughter of civilians in Mariupol and their incineration using mobile crematoriums.  That would tell of a Kremlin which set out to unleash orchestrated horrors unseen since the Holocaust. If we will not deploy Nato troops to stop Russia, sanctions must bankrupt them — whatever hardship that brings to Europe. IT’S tough to fathom the minds of British social media conspiracy theorists who make excuses for, or openly back, Putin. This madness unites the Corbynite hard Left with right-wing anti-vaxers. Such is their loathing for the West’s media and governments they literally believe the Kremlin’s absurd lies over filmed testimony from traumatised Ukrainian widows who saw their husbands casually executed by Russians. Football’s Matt Le Tissier isn’t that craven, though he too disputes the truth of the massacres in Bucha.  What are he and others struggling to grasp? Ex-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev says Putin aims to build an empire stretching to Portugal.  Do the conspiracists really think a tyrant of such monstrous and wicked ambition, a new Hitler, would level Ukrainian cities but NOT \xadterrorise and massacre civilians? The Soviets used to call such sympathisers “useful idiots”.  It is far too mild a term for those now siding with evil. MONSTROUS Jon Venables must be kept behind bars. Since he murdered James Bulger the system has treated HIM as a victim. In 2001 he was freed with a new ID and a lifelong media gagging order. Yet he was then caught twice with child sex abuse images and is back inside. Venables plans another freedom bid before the Justice Secretary can secure legal powers to veto parole rulings.  Dominic Raab will fear the killer could hoodwink the panel, as in 2013. The Parole Board must spare him the worry. Venables remains a danger to children. He blew his second and third chances — he must not be given a fourth.","Matt Le Tissier, James Bulger, Jon Venables, Dmitry Medvedev, Putin, Liz Truss, Hitler, Dominic Raab, Venables",sun_news
86,4/8/2022,"We must cripple Putin’s finances NOW, not when Germany considers it convenient","“AN evil without limits.” Who could possibly argue now with President Zelensky’s condemnation of Putin? Russia’s once-proud army — reduced to a brainwashed horde of racist rapists and executioners — has massacred in plain sight scores of harmless civilians waiting for trains out of the war zone. Women and kids, warned to leave to avoid being killed, but deliberately blown to pieces by a shell labelled “for the children”, presumably indicating revenge as a motive. Russia’s criminal Kremlin regime, its terrorist troops and its apparently stone-hearted and complicit people are damned now for generations. We and the free nations of the West must unite to defeat them with massive military support to Ukraine, paralysing sanctions and warm-hearted generosity towards those who manage to escape. For all his flaws, Boris Johnson is leading the world admirably on the first two. On the third Britain is failing abysmally. Hundreds of thousands have offered space in their homes. They are being betrayed, and our country shamed, by a useless Home Office which has approved only one in 40 visas and for which even Priti Patel is now moved to apologise. Quite why the Home Secretary cannot light a fire under her idle and inept civil servants is beyond us. Council jobsworths, meanwhile, are making the Homes For Ukraine process even more cumbersome and ineffective by ruling out some properties over laughable health and safety concerns. Does any sane person really fear that refugees fleeing Russian missiles might be at new risk from uncarpeted British floorboards or overly steep stairs? What a perfect example of the red tape that routinely strangles Britain. But our failings are insignificant against those of Germany and others whose vast payments for Russian gas are still bankrolling the genocide. We accept that Chancellor Olaf Scholz is having to pick up the pieces of Angela Merkel’s catastrophic appeasement of Putin and deranged energy policies. But he is still choosing Germany’s economic comfort over innocent lives and the futures of Ukraine and Europe itself. He hopes to ditch Kremlin gas by mid-2024. That will be far, far too late. Britain, the US and EU must enable Zelensky to prevail NOW, sending planes, tanks and a vast arsenal. We must cripple Putin’s finances NOW, not just as soon as comfortable Germans consider it convenient. The horrors so far in Ukraine are only the start. We are in a race to prevent more. WE all need a break from war and angry politics, even a brief one. So thank God for the feast of sport this weekend: Man City-Liverpool and the Aussie Grand Prix tomorrow. But first, of course, the National at 5.15pm on Saturday. We’re under starter’s orders already.

87,4/15/2022,Zelensky and courageous Ukrainians must be reassured the West will always stand by their side,"RUSSIA’S state machinery has spewed out a contradictory jumble of lies over the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva. With typical mendacity, the Kremlin first tried to insist the cruiser was not sent to its watery grave by Ukrainian missiles, but as the result of a fire. Now one of Vladimir Putin’s ludicrous apologists tells Russian state TV the Moskva was in fact torpedoed by “Nato apparatus” — triggering “World War 3”. Russia’s response yesterday was to pummel Kyiv, and threaten all kinds of bloodthirsty revenge for the humiliation of its single biggest loss at sea since 1905. For all the Ukrainian heroics, Putin is digging in for a long, hideous onslaught.  The West must respond in kind. Boris Johnson has led the way in supplying lethal aid.  Germany has to follow suit, and stop giving Putin blood-soaked billions to keep his gas taps flowing. And docile US President Joe Biden must match his talk of Russia’s “genocide” with action and no longer balk at sending Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky all the armoury he is asking for. With fighting in the east only set to intensify, hopes of a negotiated peace seem more distant than ever. Which makes it even more vital for President Zelensky and his courageous people to be reassured that the West will always stand by their side. WE are glad it was Prince Harry who initiated this week’s meeting with his grandmother en route to his latest Invictus Games in the Netherlands. More cynical royal-watchers may wonder if the Sussexes’ rendezvous with the Queen will merely end up as material for a podcast or tell-all interview. And of course, it would have been preferable if Harry and Meghan could have prioritised attending Prince Philip’s memorial service last month. But Easter is a time for new beginnings so for Her Majesty’s sake let’s hope that’s what this is, and that Harry brings the kids next time so little Lilibet can finally meet the great-gran whose name she carries. EVER wonder why the Home Office has for so long been political kryptonite for any Cabinet minister appointed to lead it? The latest insight into the day-to-day priorities of the department’s floundering civil servants may offer a clue. Staff working on immigration services have been ordered to end all emails by declaring whether they are a man, woman or non-binary — which ironically has resulted in complaints that the Home Office is breaching the Equalities Act. Is it too much to hope they might worry less about policing pronouns — and more about processing the visas of desperate Ukrainian refugees?","Boris Johnson, Volodymyr Zelensky, Vladimir Putin, Moskva, Sussexes, Lilibet, Joe Biden, Prince Philip, Prince Harry, Putin, Queen, Harry, Meghan, Zelensky",sun_news
88,4/18/2022,Britain should be immensely proud to be arming Ukraine for its heroic fightback,"BRITAIN should be immensely proud to be arming Ukraine for its heroic fightback. Russia’s overhyped hordes — ill-trained, ill-equipped and often mutinous — are being pushed back.  As many as 20,000 are dead, including several generals. Their flagship is under water. The Kremlin’s cowardly, racist troops seem adept only at defiling and murdering women, children and old people and looting their homes. What this criminal regime does have, aside from nukes, is air power and the willingness to destroy cities. So we are absolutely right to give President Zelensky our Stormer air defence system to blast Putin’s planes out of the sky as Ukraine attacks in the East. Britain, in the grip of a cost of living crisis, is giving Boris Johnson little credit.  But he and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace have answered Ukraine’s call with unmatched clarity and courage. It is unthinkable to let Russian fascism conquer a sovereign nation in Europe. Some say our troops should fight directly, even risking nuclear war. We disagree. History will nonetheless record that Britain never hesitated to back Ukraine’s fight to stay free. DON’T believe a word when Extinction Rebellion’s criminal rabble claim to regret the misery they inflict on ordinary people. In fact they hold all-night parties to revel in it. Lost on these hysterical idiots is the stupidity of targeting a country decarbonising faster than most of the world.  A country whose emissions, even if they were eliminated today, would make a negligible impact on the global climate without bigger nations following suit. Our population already backs a greener planet, just not the apocalyptic fantasies of Roger Hallam’s doomsday cult. When these road-blocking eco clowns feign sorrow over the crippling delays and shortages they cause they are lying. They relish your suffering — and mock it at parties organised to celebrate it. DOES Prince Harry ever engage his brain? His remarks about wanting to create “a more equal world” set a new high bar for his ridiculousness. Who doesn’t want more equal opportunity for all? But Harry, the living embodiment of inequality, is one of the last people who can champion it. His children won’t grow up in a more equal world, no matter how many Netflix puff movies or banal Spotify podcasts he and Meghan make.  They will grow up millionaires in a sun-drenched California mansion funded by Harry’s random privilege and unearned wealth. As long as the Montecito miseries make a fortune by cashing in on their fame as former British Royals, their “inequality” battle will forever be a sick joke.","Ben Wallace, Boris Johnson, Netflix, Roger Hallam, Putin, Harry, Meghan, DOES Prince Harry, Zelensky",sun_news
89,5/24/2022,Ukraine must feel no pressure to surrender anything to Putin – we must back heroic Zelensky with words and arms,"PUTIN’S deranged war on his neighbour is a catastrophic failure.  But he can still pull a victory from the jaws of defeat if the West’s unity crumbles. It must not. The Russian madman predicted his supposedly mighty military would conquer Ukraine in days, cheered on by grateful locals liberated from “Nazis” the Kremlin made up. It was a monumental blunder. In three months he has destroyed Russia’s global standing and its economy and seen up to 30,000 of his troops killed. His army stands exposed as an amateurish rabble of brainwashed, racist cut-throats and rapist cowards. It is mocked worldwide for its ineptitude. Russia is isolated and ruined. What can Putin do now? He could plough on against \xadwell-armed, highly motivated Ukrainian forces, sending thousands more conscripted Russian boys to their doom until his final humiliating defeat.  In desperation he could nuke Kyiv and lose even his last remaining allies, such as China, while risking a Kremlin coup. Or he could announce victory, inform Russia’s gullible population that he has already won all the territory he sought, then offer President Zelensky a bogus peace deal which maintains the Kremlin’s stranglehold on Ukraine’s economy. That indeed seems to be the plan. And some Western leaders will be itching to urge Zelensky to accept. The EU’s Macron and Scholz are flaky. They care only for their own economies. The tougher resolve of Boris Johnson and others must prevail. It is vital President Biden feels the same. Putin is a murderer and a snake. Not one word can be trusted, whatever he offers. Ukraine has fought heroically. It alone must determine when all this ends. Zelensky must feel no pressure to surrender anything, not the Donbas, not even Crimea, to cut German utility bills. The West must not falter. Putin’s butchery must reap no reward. We must back Zelensky as one, with words and arms. IF they aren’t already, energy bills will be apocalyptic by October. Millions will be unable to keep warm once the price cap soars to £2,800. This is a global problem caused by the war, but it falls to the Government to get us through it. We now know how bad it will get. It is time for Rishi Sunak to act. The Tories’ fate hinges not on parties — but on this. IMAGINE being unable to sleep for fear you will never wake. Such is life now for our own Dame Deborah James.  But still she smiles, thinks of others and talks up the Bowelbabe cause for which she has raised millions.

90,2/12/2022,The West must show united strength to prevent tyrant Putin,"VLADIMIR Putin is a power-crazed tyrant who will stop at nothing to extend his empire. But his actions are only as effective as the West allows him to be. War in Ukraine is frighteningly likely “at any time’’ because the Russian President has been able to to cynically exploit weaknesses in the democratic nations. Putin first saw his chance after President Joe Biden’s authority was fatally undermined by his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has been a pale shadow in the White House ever since. Meanwhile, Germany remains horribly compromised by its reliance on Russia for key energy supplies. And despite his high-profile posturing, the preening French President Emmanuel Macron has failed to draw a line in the snow. Boris Johnson was commendably swift in supporting Ukraine and nearby Nato countries with military aid. But he must now play a major role in strengthening Western resolve. Despite the distractions of Partygate, Boris can still summon up the spirit his allies are lacking. Preventing a bloodbath in freedom-loving Ukraine is vital, but even more is at stake. If Putin is not stopped he will only step up his efforts to divide and destabilise the West for his own ruthless ends. With an increasingly belligerent China watching in the wings, the balance of power across the world is at risk. Only by united strength can we defend freedom. When the West shows weakness our enemies pounce. THE importance of appointing the right Met Police Commissioner is summed up by the state of the Big Apple. New York has been hit by a wave of shootings, rapes and robberies since softer sentences were introduced under woke judicial guidelines. Murder rates have mushroomed, cops have been gunned down in the streets and luxury stores have been ransacked. London could go down a similar lawless path if a “soft-on-crime” Met Commissioner replaces Cressida Dick. So it is vital that Priti Patel ensures the next leader of Britain’s biggest force does not sacrifice law and order while tackling appalling levels of racism and sexism.

91,2/13/2022,Vladimir Putin is in the grip of a never-ending midlife crisis and the world is paying the price,"HAVING ditched his wife, splashed out on a fancy new palace and developed a suspiciously crease-free face, not to mention those topless horseback photos, all the signs are there that Vladimir Putin is in the grip of a never-ending midlife crisis. Now the world is paying the price for the Russian president’s insecurity complex and yearning for past glories. A tragedy is that if Putin had continued Russia’s 1990s transition to democracy, there is every chance it would by now be a valued and thriving member of the international community. But the ex-KGB spy fell back on what he knew best and reversed his nation into Soviet-era paranoia and thuggery. Under his dictatorship, Russia is an economic basketcase domestically and a pariah state internationally. Like all bullies, Putin will continue to throw his weight around as long as he is allowed to get away with it. His Kremlin’s arrogance is typified by the sneering boast by one of its ambassadors that they “don’t give a sh*t” about the threat of further economic sanctions. It is a pity then, that rather than a midlife crisis, the West is experiencing something more akin to a nervous breakdown, plagued by weak leaders and self-inflicted cultural divisions. Make no mistake: woke warriors hellbent on erasing our values are as useful to malevolent tyrants such as Putin as any helicopter fleet or infantry division. SINCE quitting Government, Lord Frost has shown his unerring knack for getting to the nub of issues, whether on Brexit or the UK’s energy supply crisis. His commonsense take on fracking is that it makes no sense to board up our domestic shale gas reserves, given we will only import the gas we need anyway, pushing up carbon emissions further. He’s spot on. So why is the Government stubbornly clinging to its ban? The Department for Business weakly claims drilling for gas could cause tremors. Safety is key, but never mind tremors, has No10 truly grasped the political earthquake heading their way if they don’t tackle the cost-of-living crisis? All the more reason to get cracking on fracking right now. WE’D like to wish a happy Valentine’s Day to ALL our readers. If you’re coupled-up, we hope romantic bliss prevails for at least 24 hours.

92,2/14/2022,The West has been woefully naive over Putin’s criminal regime – that must end now,"THE West must stand united and ready with crippling sanctions, seizures and expulsions Russia cannot mock. The Kremlin respects strength — nothing else. That is why Putin and his thugs openly ridicule US, UK or EU politicians trying to talk them round. If they invade Ukraine, Moscow must be left totally isolated economically. No more Russian gas to Germany.  Russian banks cut out of the international system, crippling their trade. The West must supply Ukraine’s resistance and fund Russia’s opposition. It is vital Putin’s citizens learn the real \xadreason their sons are being slaughtered. Meanwhile Britain must target Kremlin-linked oligarchs, seizing their assets and London mansions, removing their children from our public schools, deporting entire families.  They have laundered their billions here too long. For 20 years the West has been woefully naive over Putin’s criminal regime. That must end now, invasion or not. THE latest Government anti-fracking excuse is a smokescreen for its cowardice. It has no stomach to fight the scaremongers who killed our potentially huge shale industry, even though our need for cheap gas is now far more urgent. So Energy Secretary Greg Hands says he would need “compelling scientific evidence” that it’s safe. What drivel.  The public was only persuaded it was unsafe by a campaign of misinformation and conspiracy theories which Tory Governments have been too timid to counter. Yes, drilling for shale triggers earthquakes. So does coal mining.  They are tiny ones no one can feel.  And the environmental damage is vastly exaggerated. UK fracking would have been regulated far more tightly than America’s. But our earthquake “safety” level was set so farcically high it was unworkable. Producing cheap gas from shale is our best bet until, in a few decades, we can achieve the Net Zero dream and solely use wind, solar and nuclear power. The Government needs to grow a spine. WHY was vicious sex predator Paul \xadRobson in an open prison . . . this danger to “anyone he comes across” — but women and young children especially?

Given their notorious record for gullibilty, why didn’t the then Justice Secretary properly investigate that decision? Indeed why are ANY still-dangerous sex offenders in open prisons?

93,2/17/2022,We must impose sanctions on Russia if Putin fails to meet deadline for withdrawal,"THE West must not buckle. It must not give Putin an inch. He may yet be crazy enough to invade Ukraine and see thousands of young men return to Moscow in coffins. Britain and the US think he is. But it is still surely more likely the Kremlin wants to keep Europe on the brink of war for weeks, months even, to extract crucial concessions. It must get none.  It will be years if ever before Ukraine joins Nato, a development Putin dreads.  But that possibility must be kept alive.  He cannot be handed a single reward for his belligerence. Putin heads a murderous regime.  Its words are worthless: A fake retreat, proclamations of innocence, lie after lie. Now the \xadpredicted “false flag” attack. The leaders of France and Germany are weak men out of their depth. Ours, and others in the EU, must not flinch. Moscow is already threatened with crippling sanctions if it invades. We should now impose them if Putin fails to meet a deadline for withdrawal from Ukraine’s borders. PRINCE Andrew’s demise is no one’s fault but his own. The Queen certainly deserves no criticism.  But the Royals should also know this: Much of the public is outraged £12million was spent to keep Andrew’s sex case details quiet, at least for now. The Royals can try to muddy the waters over exactly how that vast sum was funded. But the bottom line is they get £80million-plus a year from taxpayers via the Sovereign Grant. It is sophistry to suggest the public hasn’t just paid £12million to buy a sex abuse victim’s silence.  That sickens us. We feel sorry for Andrew’s family.  But taxpayers will NEVER accept him as a Royal, however much he deludes himself.  His presence harms the institution. What’s more, the public will resent funding his lavish upkeep in retirement. It is unfortunate if his modest skill-set and tainted reputation render him largely unemployable.  But the arrogant Duke enjoyed decades of jet-setting playboy fun.  It’s time he earned a crust. How about by washing the Royal limos? THIS time we can’t say we weren’t warned. Nor can the Government. In 1987 the Great Storm even took weathermen by surprise.  As you read this, we may already be in the eye of what they predict will be the most ferocious since.  We must hope for the best. This is a moment for our PM to put aside his Partygate woes and show his mettle. To direct rapid relief to the worst-hit areas. To listen.  In weeks to come let us not be reporting on families still flooded and without power. Meanwhile, folks, batten down the hatches.

94,2/19/2022,It’s time for Western leaders to stiffen their spine and stand up to power-mad Putin,"BORIS JOHNSON’S warning at the Munich Security Conference yesterday was bleak. “After a generation of freedom, we’re now staring at a generation of bloodshed and misery.” In a bold but calculated speech, the Prime Minister spelled out the chilling consequences of failing to face down brutal tyrant Vladimir Putin. Not only would the invasion of Ukraine be “a shock that would echo around the world’’ it would also send out the message that brutish aggression works when dealing with the West. If power-mad President Putin’s land grab cannot be stopped, Boris made clear Russia must ultimately fail and be seen to fail. There is still a fast-diminishing chance of avoiding war. But Western democracies must stiffen their spines to defend freedom. While a properly funded Nato is vital, we can no longer rely on a dithering and divided EU to counter new challenges. Plans for a new European Security Council headed up by Britain but independent from Brussels could be a good place to start. Boris’s powerful words yesterday can only bolster his credentials. As he said, Britain has repeatedly proved its commitment to freedom and democracy. It’s time for some other Western leaders to show theirs. WE DEFEND freedom in the face of Putin, yet a new ruling means privacy laws in the UK are a gift to criminals. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab today pledges to halt the “creep” of such legislation. He has to do more than that. It is vital that the Government does everything in its power to reverse last week’s Supreme Court decision to protect the privacy of ALL suspects by granting anonymity until charge. It brings the terrifying prospect of widescale secret justice a huge step nearer. In the last few years British judges have turned a trickle of privacy legislation into a raging flood. Time to turn back the tide now Mr Raab. SARAH Harding’s death from breast cancer at 39 was a terrible tragedy.

95,2/22/2022,Sanctions on Russia go nowhere near far enough to deter Putin’s land grab,"ALMOST as disturbing as the sight of Russian tanks rumbling into Ukraine was the speech by Vladimir Putin that preceded it. Not just for its Orwellian content, in which the Kremlin dictator rewrote history to deny Ukraine’s right to exist independently, but also for its delivery. Gone was the cold, calculated master-manipulator. In his place was a rambling, unhinged tyrant, hellbent on a war that could destabilise the entire world. His actions have, at least, shaken our allies from their stupor. Germany merits credit for belatedly agreeing to yank the drip of Russian gas out of its arm by suspending the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. But if the leaders of the US, Germany, France and the EU had not previously been so weak, there is a chance Putin’s calculations might have been different. Even now, the sanctions go nowhere near far enough to deter his land grab. Boris Johnson and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace have been admirable in their resolve to stand up to Moscow. They must urge our allies to take off the kid gloves on more sanctions — and themselves be ready to go much further than yesterday’s tame opening salvo. It’s not just Germany who will take an economic hit from facing down Vlad — supply issues mean Brits too will see price rises in petrol, bread and beer. But the West must do all it can to slam the brakes on this dictator’s conquest — or risk emboldening him still further. Even sporting bodies can do their bit to punish Putin, by finally treating Russia as the rogue state it has long been. Uefa can start by stripping St Petersburg of the Champions League final. All involved must by now have no doubt: a slap on the paw will not be enough to check the Russian bear’s rampage. SO who’s to blame for Putin’s invasion? If you’re Jeremy Corbyn or his Stop The War coalition of loons, the answer is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the UK. Yes, these deluded patsies have allowed their hatred of their own country to distort reality so far that they find themselves protesting against “the British government’s aggressive posturing”. Never forget that Keir Starmer spent years campaigning for Red Jez to be PM. Had he succeeded, it chills us to think what craven signs of “solidarity” a Corbyn government would now be sending Putin. IS it any wonder that a poll has found handymen to be the best lovers?

96,2/23/2022,Boris Johnson must lead a full tilt charge at the wealth of Putin and his cronies now,"BORIS Johnson’s logic for placing only a tame set of sanctions on Russia so far is that Putin needs to fear there will be worse to come if he launches a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In other confrontations, that might make perfect sense. But the reality of the current situation is that Putin has already crossed the line and — in the words of the PM’s own Defence Secretary — gone “full tonto”. It’s also far from the first time the tyrant has taken a chunk out of a neighbouring nation. So there is no point ratcheting up sanctions slowly. It’s far better to hit Putin with their full force now — and weaken him for the conflict that looks grimly inevitable. The charge facing the PM is that he has been talking the talk on the UK’s commitment to target the ill-gotten gains of Putin’s kleptocrats, but isn’t yet walking the walk. As the respected RUSI think-tank put it, his initial sanctions are akin to “turning up to a gunfight with a peashooter”. The PM would not be short of domestic support if he went further. Tory backbenchers and experts on Russia and military strategy alike are clamouring for it. Russia — with its basketcase economy — does not have the deepest of pockets and funding a prolonged military offensive while under meaningful sanctions will cripple Putin. It could also trigger what the increasingly deranged dictator fears above all: a bloody internal coup. Crucially, as ex-Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt argued yesterday, it is not only the severity of sanctions that matters, but also their durability. Western nations can no longer delude themselves that they can “reset relations with Moscow” by ditching punitive measures at the first opportunity. They need only heed the warning from Ukraine’s foreign minister yesterday that Europe is hurtling towards a “devastating catastrophe that no nation will be able to sit out”. Boris must lead a full tilt charge at the wealth of Putin and his cronies now, while increasing our resilience against the inevitable cyber-attacks that follow. IT sickens us to hear that James Bulger’s killer Jon Venables is plotting a fresh bid to be freed from jail. Venables, aged ten when he and his friend Robert Thompson abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James in 1993, has been released twice before. Both times, after being given a new life and identity at great expense, he had to be locked up again for hoarding images of children being sexually abused.

97,2/24/2022,"We must dig deep to beat Vladimir Putin, the Hitler of our age","A MAD, murderous dictator threatens to unleash a nuclear world war. No longer is this a mere movie plot. Today it is terrifyingly real. It is paramount, as in 1939, that the free peoples of the West defeat this hideous new evil, this Hitler for our times. Some Britons, justifiably jaded by foreign wars, want nothing to do with Ukraine. But it cannot be ignored and nor should it. Vladimir Putin is inflicting his monstrous tyranny on an innocent population. And, if unrestrained, he will keep coming. Decades of unpunished crimes and unchallenged power have addled his mind. Forget his ludicrous denials and lies — such as Russia being “threatened” by Nato, a defensive alliance, or that he is “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. The chilling reality is that he has publicly declared that a \xaddemocratic country of 43million people has no right to exist. With age now against him, he intends to go down in history as the man who, by force, folded Ukraine into Russia before establishing a new empire to replace the Soviet Union he still mourns. Putin will turn a deaf ear to the screams of children he orphans — and a blind eye to the cities he destroys and the thousands he slaughters, his own soldiers included. He believes this is his \xaddestiny. Only Western might, economic and military, will deny him. Sanctions, our greatest weapon until he actually attacks a Nato member, have the power to cripple Russia. But they will hurt us too. \xa0Food and fuel prices will rocket, inflicting further hardship on top of soaring inflation. That is a grim prospect which the Government can do more to alleviate. But we must endure it. Because for all our sakes, and those of our children and grandchildren, democracy must be defended to the end. It must prevail over the demented ambitions of evil men. Most of us in the West are not currently blessed with great leaders and Putin knows it. The fractious, feeble, hand-wringing squabblers of the EU. America’s frail, doddering Joe Biden, pathetically intoning as the tanks rolled in that “Jill and I are praying for” Ukraine. Boris Johnson, for all his other troubles, was commendably more forthright: “This hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,” he said. We should be thankful for that. And for the fact that if two elections had gone another way the Russian tyrant would have support in both Downing Street and the White House: The Nato-hating, Kremlin-backing Marxist Corbyn and the Putin fanboy Trump. Both typify the long, shameful denialism over the true menace from Russia and China, right across the political spectrum in Britain, America and the EU. Nations desperate for Russian fuel and investment cosied up to this openly toxic and murderous regime. Leaders even congratulated Putin on winning blatantly rigged elections.  Angela Merkel brainlessly closed Germany’s nuclear power stations and left her country mainly reliant on Russian gas and coal.\xa0 Repeated Putin invasions and outrages met with next to no response. We expelled a few diplomats over the Salisbury poisonings, then continued to let Kremlin-linked criminal oligarchs launder billions in London, buy up the finest mansions and send their kids to our top schools. This tolerance was even more putrid on the hard-Left.  Even yesterday, as Keir Starmer “addressed the nation” over the crisis, a rabble of his backbenchers were still blaming Nato for it. Starmer, let’s not \xadforget, campaigned for them to run the country in 2019. Russia is not, and was not, our friend. Nor China. Nor evidently is President Imran Khan of Pakistan — ex-cricket star, Taliban supporter and giddily excited visitor to Moscow as the invasion got under way.  How those English cricket pundits must wonder today about this legend of the game they still like and revere. All of us in the West should have woken up years ago.  But if there was still any doubt about Putin his not-so-veiled threat to nuke countries standing in his way must end them for good. The man is deranged. Yesterday’s fresh sanctions are welcome but still insufficient. There must be more and they must be \xadbrutal and immediate: Expel every Russian ambassador. They merely lie for Putin. Shut down his propaganda channels.  They do too. Bar Russia from hosting or participating in every international sporting and cultural event. Sever all global sponsorship deals with Russian firms. Lock them out of all international finance systems including SWIFT. Round up scores more Kremlin-linked oligarchs, seize their London homes and deport them and their families. Ban all Russian gas exports. “In each barrel there is Ukrainian blood,” as a Ukrainian MP said \xadyesterday. To replace it, ramp up production in the North Sea and start fracking in the UK. We must aim to bankrupt Moscow’s war machine while funding Ukraine forces so effectively that Putin’s troops quickly realise he has led them to their doom. The Ukrainian resistance must have every weapon and intelligence capability we can supply.\xa0 Our vast aid budget must support refugees fleeing the war zone. As for our own forces, let us hear no more about cuts. Reducing our fighting strength has been a tragic error of post-Cold War complacency. We must increase it and be fully ready if Putin does somehow crush Ukraine and comes for a Nato state next. Ultimately, perhaps our greatest hope is the Russian people.  Many are already aghast at this atrocity \xadcarried out in their name on their neighbours. Hundreds are bravely rallying in the streets at huge risk. Perhaps when Russia’s sons begin returning home in coffins, those protests will erupt into an irresistible revolt which ends the dark era of Putin and the grotesque lackeys who keep him in power.","Angela Merkel, Boris Johnson, Corbyn, Imran Khan, Vladimir Putin, Jill, Joe Biden, Putin, Britons, Trump, Hitler, Salisbury",sun_news
98,2/25/2022,West too slow and self-interested to hit Russia with serious financial sanctions,"AS Ukrainians bravely lay down their lives to stop Vladimir Putin’s monstrous march on Kyiv, what is the West doing? Continuing to haggle over a sanctions package which, while an improvement on the lame initial effort, remains riddled with holes. For instance, Boris Johnson last night repeated his demand that Russia is ejected from Swift, the major financial payments system for international trade — but Germany is baulking at that step. Meanwhile the Italians watered down sanctions to exclude Italian-made luxury designer handbags, and the Belgians (centre of Europe’s diamond trade) got a similar loophole for diamonds. For its part, the UK only decided last night to slap sanctions on Putin and his foreign affairs henchman Sergei Lavrov. Why didn’t this happen on Day One? Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy is in despair, pleading with the West — in particular Europe — to go further and “act without delay”. Putin, closely watched by his Chinese ally President Xi, has staked his bet that the West’s outrage at his warmongering will, in the long term, be trumped by economic self-interest.  🔵 Read our Russia - Ukraine live blog for the very latest updates  For all our sakes, we pray he has fatally underestimated his enemy. Tragically, the omens are not good. FINALLY. After days of shameful prevarication, UEFA has decided Russia should lose the right to host this year’s Champions League final. F1 has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix, too, and Man Utd have conceded it’s no longer acceptable to fill their coffers with cash from Russian state airline Aeroflot. All of these decisions were taken in the face of public pressure — and only after the bodies of Ukrainians began to pile up in the country’s streets. Better late than never. But our sporting bodies need to know that, while it may be inconvenient for their bank balances, where they get their money does matter. Putin, like other dictators before him, loves using sport as a propaganda tool, and something to give his evil regime a veneer of prestige. The tyrant was allowed to preen his feathers on the global stage as Russia hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup. The decision to award football’s premier event to Putin’s mafia regime was lambasted as a corrupt folly at the time — and looks even more so now. Russia must not be considered for any hosting of international sporting or cultural events for as long as this bloodthirsty despot remains in power. He has crossed the line far too many times","Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson, Vladimir Putin, Man Utd, Putin, Zelenskyy, Xi",sun_news
99,2/27/2022,"Vladimir Putin today cuts a desperate, unhinged and isolated figure","VLADIMIR Putin today cuts a desperate, unhinged and isolated figure. Thanks to the extraordinary bravery of British-trained Ukrainian forces, he has failed to overrun the country quickly and faces being bogged down in a lengthy guerilla war. Germany has finally woken up to Britain’s calls and agreed to join the ban on money transfers using the global Swift system. Following years of foreign policy weakness, the EU has at last agreed to send weapons to Ukraine — the first time it has ever armed a nation state. Most devastatingly of all, half of Putin’s vast £640billion cash reserves owned by Russia’s Central Bank — including a third held in the EU — face being frozen. Such an attack on a nuclear power’s central bank has never been tried before. The shockwaves could be immense. Russia now faces bankruptcy on a scale not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Putin is being cornered and the West is, belatedly, united in a common purpose. But with his thumb poised over the nuclear button he remains more dangerous to the world than ever. As the pressure remorselessly cranks up it will be for the Russian people — perhaps even Russian generals — to decide how to save their country from a man who seems bent on sending them into oblivion. 🔵 Read our Russia - Ukraine live blog for the very latest updates  NEARLY 400,000 refugees have already fled Ukraine — mainly women and children who have left their men behind to fight the murderous Putin regime. Many more will be forced to follow, with five million expected to be caught in the chaos. Families are being broken up at border posts, not knowing if they will ever be reunited. Anguished toddlers are weeping as they say goodbye to Daddy. The scale of the human tragedy unfolding is immense and heartbreaking. Ukraine’s free and democratic neighbours are doing what they can to help, distributing food, clothes and medical supplies.

100,3/1/2022,Britain’s money should no longer fund Russia and the government must cut all Kremlin links,"WORKING in Britain for the Kremlin or its stooges was always morally dubious at best. Now it is treacherous and repugnant. So we have no problem with a proposed legal clamp on lawyers, PR firms or bean counters working for dodgy \xadoligarchs with proven Kremlin links. As Putin ramps up his hideous assault on Ukraine, so our sanctions must deepen to cause grief to his cronies and, ultimately, him. If that also includes what Sajid Javid branded the “white-collar collaborators” with the Hitler of the 21st Century, so be it. Another MP claims certain lawyers at London law firms Harbottle and Lewis, Carter Ruck and CMS have risked their reputations allegedly helping oligarchs intimidate our free Press. There are other measures the West must take. Russia’s continued presence on the UN Security Council must end. So must UK aid to Imran Khan’s Pakistan, which backs Russia and has even signed a new deal to buy its wheat. Our money must not fund hostile states. TWO years ago The Sun urged Keir Starmer to cut all his hard-Left MPs adrift. He didn’t. But he has now threatened them — and like-minded Labour members — with expulsion from the party if they repeat their brainless claims that Nato \xad“provoked” Russia. Credit to Starmer. That’s progress. The only snag being: These Corbynite goons are still on his back benches. And we all know what they truly believe. IT has been obvious the Government has no idea of the gargantuan cost of Net Zero. It is still monumentally depressing to have that confirmed by an official report. The Sun would love a zero-emissions Britain. But the random 2050 target date was made law blindly and without a clue how to achieve it. That is still so. What will it cost families? How will the Treasury replace billions lost in fuel duty if cars are all electric? No10 doesn’t know. It has a vague faith in future technologies to lower costs. That’s it. The truth is that MPs on all sides fear being straight with voters on the issue. They know a public whose bills are already rocketing won’t wear extra costs. IF politicians thought their stock was low they ain’t seen nothing yet. Next month, as council tax and the energy price cap soar, millions are dragged into higher rate tax and ALL workers stung for extra National Insurance, MPs will trouser a 2.7 per cent rise of £2,212. They should reject it. The Government must bin its suicidal NI rise too. Skint voters will detest being taken for April fools by MPs on £84,144 a year. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

101,3/4/2022,It is heartbreaking to feel so powerless against nuclear-armed tyrant Putin,"THE Ukraine carnage grows ever more horrific, with worse to come. What can we do? For all the heroism of its resistance, the stricken country’s brave citizens are now being indiscriminately slaughtered and its proud cities bombed to ruins. The Kremlin monster Putin denies Ukraine’s right to exist. If it won’t surrender he’ll wipe it off the map, emboldened by the West’s refusal to risk the nuclear Armageddon he has threatened. He may well be bluffing on that. What if he’s not? Nato is right not to gamble with hundreds of millions of lives by launching air strikes on Russian forces. But we SHOULD hugely increase the supply of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, drones and other weapons to Ukraine’s soldiers. And though President Biden is quick to say what he WON’T do to help, he too can provide much greater support given his vast military resources. Putin is perhaps still most likely to be stopped by his own nervous generals or his increasingly angry and horrified people. Thousands more Russian troop casualties may speed that process. Meanwhile we must get food, water, shelter and medicine to the one million refugees who have fled and millions more under siege. Your donations to our appeal for the Red Cross will be vital. It is heartbreaking to feel so powerless against this nuclear-armed tyrant and his unprovoked and maniacal war. For now, weapons, crippling sanctions and our relief for victims are all we have. 🔵 Read our Russia - Ukraine live blog for the very latest updates  DID the murder of Sarah Everard prove a turning-point in ending violence against women? Tragically and shamefully it did not. In the year since, at least 125 more have died violent deaths in the UK.For all the Government’s fine promises after Sarah’s abduction by an evil cop, nothing much has changed. A review was launched into the Met. But it remains a swamp of misogynistic bigotry, even under a female chief. Our police, prosecutors and courts systematically fail victims, with only 1.3 per cent of recorded rapes and 2.9 per cent of sex assaults leading to a charge. Even those few take years to come to trial — years of agonising delay before there’s even a glimmer of justice. It is disgusting that in 2022 women still routinely feel unsafe on our streets. We need action, PM. Not more words. WHAT a joke Britain’s wokest jail, HMP Five Wells, looks. It’s true that many other prisons are squalid cesspits where inmates learn nothing, leave without hope and go straight back into crime. But there’s surely a balance to strike. A gentle stretch in a lavishly-equipped \xadluxury jail with no bars, where lags are “residents” and everyone calls the governor John, is barely punishment at all. HMP? It’s an AirBnB.","Biden, John, Sarah Everard, HMP, Putin, Sarah",sun_news
102,3/5/2022,Putin’s ‘act of war’ outburst shows sanctions are strangling him,"VLADIMIR PUTIN’S evil was inspired by a massive failing from the West. He was watching closely when blundering Joe Biden abandoned our allies in Afghanistan last year. Now the madman in the Kremlin is counting on us repeating that mistake over Ukraine. But Putin has miscalculated. Far from the West becoming divided over Ukraine, the conflict has united us. The gut-wrenching images of war have pressured pacifist Germany to re-arm, humble Finland to seek safety in NATO and even the neutral Swiss to come off the fence. And unlike the paper tiger in the White House, Ukraine’s Iron Man President Volodymr Zelenskyy has emerged as one of the greatest leaders of the 21st Century. His emotional speeches from the war zone have stirred the world. But his demands yesterday for a no-fly zone must still be treated with caution. Such a move would play right into Putin’s hands and allow him the excuse he craves to escalate the crisis. Britain must get as many anti-tank missiles and other weapons as we can to the brave Ukrainian troops. 🔵 Read our Russia - Ukraine live blog for the very latest updates  But the best route to defeating the tyrant remains economic. Boris Johnson has led the way in applying Russian sanctions which are hurting Putin so much he yesterday declared them “an act of war’’ and even made threats to Britain. Ordinary Russians have relied on Western goods for too long now to put up with going back to Soviet era queues. Putin’s outburst yesterday shows sanctions are slowly strangling him. PUTIN’S oligarch cronies must never be allowed to dodge sanctions by hiding behind human rights laws. It is disgraceful if privacy-obsessed legal firms, which have obstructed the British press for years, are now helping to shield oligarchs as Ukraine burns. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab must act urgently so rich and powerful wrongdoers can no longer hide their private lives or cash from proper scrutiny. Ministers have been talking about reforming human rights legislation for years. Now get on with it. BRAVE Nastya Zagoruychik took a picture of herself with Winston Churchill’s statue to send home after fleeing the war. For her it is a proud symbol of liberty.

103,3/6/2022,Britain has let its military spending shrivel for too long – we must restore it,"VLADIMIR Putin’s remorseless invasion of Ukraine is a throwback to the last century that few thought likely a fortnight ago. It also requires an urgent revision of our own military spending, which likewise needs restoring to 20th century levels, having been allowed to shrivel for too long. The prevailing wisdom was that land wars in Europe were a thing of the past and that the UK’s needs would be better served with a nimbler — for which read smaller and cheaper — military. But while it’s true that our Armed Forces do need to evolve to thwart new types of threat, it is now depressingly clear that they cannot afford to blithely discount the old threats either.  Putin’s menace could last for many years yet. None of which is happy reading for Rishi Sunak, already beset by cash demands on all sides. Yet it is a challenge the Chancellor must rise to.  A government’s first duty is to protect its people. THE countless stories of Ukrainian bravery these past 11 days have stirred us all. One man who knows a thing or two about gutsiness is Craig Monaghan, a wounded veteran of the Afghan war. Craig, a winner at The Sun’s 2020 Military Awards, is now among a group who have crossed the “Gates of Hell” into Ukraine with a convoy to deliver medical aid and evacuate refugees. How that bravery contrasts with the cowardly attacks by Russian forces who, after finding Ukraine’s fighters more than a match, target civilians trying to flee during a so-called ceasefire Such horrors provide ample justification for the extension to all Ukrainians of the right to apply for sanctuary in the UK, and we applaud Home Secretary Priti Patel for seeking the change. But such contemptible slaughter should tell French president Emmanuel Macron that his lengthy pleading calls to Putin aren’t worth the price of the phone bill Putin has no better nature to appeal to. He is evil incarnate. WITH quotes for annual gas bills starting to surge above £4,000, the cost-of-living crisis has never seemed so real. And yet within a fortnight, two shale gas wells in Lancashire are set to be sealed for good, filled with concrete. Asked yesterday whether the Government would look to fracking or a return to coal to expand energy supplies, Dominic Raab shot down the coal option. On fracking, however, the Deputy Prime Minister was conspicuously silent. Could that be a sign No10 might finally see sense and heed the dozens of Tory MPs urging a reversal of the ban? It’s one thing to look a gift horse in the mouth.  But it’s pure folly to pour concrete down its throat.","Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab, VLADIMIR Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Priti Patel, Sun, Putin, Craig Monaghan, Craig",sun_news
104,3/10/2022,We must send thousands more defensive weapons to help Ukraine repel the REAL Nazis,"PUTIN’S psychopathic brutality is now crystal clear to all except his ridiculous \xadpropagandists and Russia’s duped citizens. Still his lies keep coming: That no civilians are being targeted in his “special military operation” to rid Ukraine of Nazis. Every word is false. Last night babies and women in labour lay bloodied and buried beneath the rubble of Mariupol maternity hospital, destroyed by a monstrous bomb. Refugees are now routinely shelled fleeing Putin’s terror. And if he apes his barbaric friend Assad in Syria, chemical weapons will come next. We pray the war criminals responsible for this genocide, and their supporters, face justice one way or another. It is increasingly tempting to urge Nato to dispense it instantly by blowing Putin’s hordes to kingdom come. But we just cannot risk igniting armageddon. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is absolutely right, though, to send thousands more defensive weapons to help Ukraine repel the REAL Nazis of the 21st Century. Those should include our world-leading anti-aircraft missiles. If Nato planes cannot enforce a no-fly zone, we must enable President Zelensky’s lionhearts to do so from the ground. BRITAIN’S once proud global reputation for welcoming refugees is in grave danger. The blame lies not with the public which, while steadfastly opposed to economic migrants who illegally jump the queue, is overwhelmingly sympathetic towards those fleeing war. The fault lies instead with a failing Home Office which has proved utterly incapable of preventing thousands of illegal arrivals in small boats . . . but chucks every obstacle in the path of those infinitely more deserving. While the former are plucked to safety from the Channel, then housed in hotels at staggering expense, the latter are left out in the cold and put through a wringer of paperwork and delay. Boris Johnson defended the need for security checks yesterday. Fine. But do officials really need up to TWO WEEKS to sift wannabe terrorists from displaced, desperate Ukrainian grandparents, dads, mums and children? Contrast that with the Health Department’s warm-hearted plan to fly sick kids from the war zone here for NHS care. Running the Home Office is tough. Even so, Priti Patel’s record is not a proud one. WHEN will Rishi Sunak slash fuel duty like Ireland? Each day heaps more misery on working people as pump prices and energy bills soar. While other countries act, our Treasury is frozen in the headlights. Rishi may fancy himself as a tax-lowering Chancellor. Now’s the time to prove it.

105,3/12/2022,Volodymyr Zelensky has united his nation – let’s make him Sir Volodymyr,"BRAVE Volodymyr Zelensky has united his nation in the face of overwhelming odds. The Ukrainian president’s unflinching stand against Vladimir Putin has shamed wobbling Western leaders. His defiant oratory, including last week’s inspirational address to the Commons, has kept the spotlight on the brutal Russian war machine. By refusing to back down to tyrants or flee from the front line he embodies values that Brits hold dear. So why not send an unequivocal message of support to him and his countrymen by granting him an honorary knighthood? Of course such an award in the Queen’s birthday honours would not stop President Putin in his tracks. But it would be another slap in the face for the depraved despot in the Kremlin. As MP Bob Seely says: “President Zelensky has been a true leader. “He has given a voice and set an example to his people in their hour of courage. Let’s make him Sir Volodymyr.” We couldn’t agree more. DISGRACED John Bercow’s treatment of his staff was truly appalling. The former Commons Speaker has already been exposed as a monstrous bully whose behaviour shamed Parliament. He even had his taxpayer-funded portrait altered to paint out his former private secretary after she quit over his ferocious behaviour. It is a disgrace that this deeply spiteful man can still claim a lavish public pension after all the damage he has done. State employees can be stripped of pensions if they are convicted of crimes. The odious Bercow deserves a similar fate. TV’S SATURDAY Night Takeaway has been missing a shining star for weeks. Stephen Mulhern is a vital cog in Ant & Dec’s comedy machine.

106,1/29/2022,Joe Biden’s sitting on his hands as Boris Johnson vows to protect Ukraine from Russia,"AS UKRAINIAN mothers and grandfathers practise drills with wooden rifles to protect their homeland, Joe Biden once more sits on his hands and hopes. The US president who abandoned millions to starve in Afghanistan has again failed to truly stand up and be counted in the face of tyranny. It is into this moral void that Britain — freed from a paralysed EU led by a \xadthoroughly compromised Germany — has honourably stepped.  Writing in The Sun, the PM today vows to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression by land, sea, and air. Thankfully, he is not merely offering warm words. He has rightly pledged to double within days the number of UK Armed Forces in Eastern Europe — backed by fighter jets, rocket launchers and warships. It is a significant show of support for our threatened ally. We hope the PM will be similarly tough when he confronts Vladimir Putin in talks next week. How enraging, then, that with war in Europe potentially just days away, so many remain obsessed with how many more days it will take for Sue Gray’s report into No10 parties to be published. What would we rather our PM focus on? A £1million police inquiry for a few £100 fixed penalty notices for boozy staff? Or standing up to a dictator bent on the brutal invasion of a long-time friend? Partygate may well be a mess of BoJo’s making but it is now an embarrassing sideshow compared to the sight of 130,000 Russian stormtroopers on the border. Fundamental freedoms in the world are at risk – not to mention the lives of countless innocent Ukrainians. The stakes could not be higher. IN the eye of the pandemic storm, Rishi Sunak dished out billions of pounds in loans to help companies bounce back from Covid. A lack of even basic checks allowed a huge chunk to be stolen by gangs, drug dealers and, as we reveal today, very obviously dodgy back street garages which were fronts for organised crime. Yet tens of thousands of struggling families face severe fines if they don’t pay back child benefit as their wages go up. In what amounts to a huge crackdown, tax chiefs have been told to pursue those who don’t hand back overpayments. It is deeply shocking that not a single one of the fraudsters who claimed some of the £4.3billion written off by the Government will be pursued. That’s our money, Chancellor. Instead of chasing those just about managing, how about going after the real crooks and getting it back?","Rishi Sunak, Vladimir Putin, BoJo, Joe Biden, Sue Gray",sun_news
