Ukraine's Zelensky questions UN Security Council's mandate in speech on alleged Russian atrocities,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians ""just for their pleasure"" in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself. Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia's retreat from the town in horrifying detail, describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia's actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC. The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council."" None Zelensky added: ""It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter.  What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?"" he asked.  At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had ""more than doubled"" since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17. In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18. In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was ""not a single crime"" that the Russians ""would not commit,"" alleging that Russian troops had ""searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country."" ""They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone ... They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelensky said.  ""I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,"" he told the UNSC.  ""Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,"" he continued. ""Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them."" Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given ""criminal orders"" and ""carried out them by killing our people"" to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial.  UN: Civilians were targeted Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed ""all the signs"" that civilians were ""directly targeted and directly killed.""   In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were ""very disturbing developments.""   She specifically referenced the ""disturbing"" images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals.   ""We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It's hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,"" Throssell continued.  As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn't have ""exact information"" to share regarding the situation on the ground.  Throssell also paid tribute to the ""crucial role"" that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the ""multiple teams"" involved in ""reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage.""  Russia's response Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky's remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military ""ungrounded.""   ""We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,"" Nebenzia said in translated remarks. The ambassador recalled Zelensky's election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine ""failed to materialize."" None Nebenzia also repeated past claims that ""a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military"" continue to proliferate. Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia ""came to ... Ukraine"" to bring peace, not to ""conquer lands."" Nebenzia's words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only ""groundless, but ... a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army."""
"Russian troops leave behind trail of dead civilians, flattened apartment blocks, and V signs in Ukraine's Borodianka","Oksana Kostychenko walks down a narrow pathway, leading to her back garden in Borodianka. The flower beds on one side are surprisingly well arranged, contrasting with the wanton destruction all around.  Near her garden shed is the body of a man, lying face-down with a bag over his head and hands tied behind his back. His trousers are pulled down. There are large bruises on his left leg and a large wound on his head. Next to his body is a single bullet casing.  ""He was executed, gunshot to the head,"" an officer with the Ukrainian National Police said. There are no documents on the man, but authorities on site say all indications show he was another civilian casualty of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war.  The body is one of many recently found in cities to the east of Kyiv that were occupied by Russian forces. Borodianka was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia's invasion. What was left of the town, after intense shelling and devastating airstrikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, which moved in on February 28. Yuriy Pomin was still in town when the Russian attack started. ""The scariest part was when their planes came. They were flying above our house and dropping bombs,"" Pomin told CNN.  Today, the 33-year-old is cleaning up his fourth-floor apartment. The multi-story building next to his was razed to the ground by a Russian strike, and he's moving what's left of his possessions to another house outside the city. ""I cannot stay here,"" he said. ""It's not safe."" The month-long Russian occupation has left a devastating mark on the city. Not only was it almost entirely destroyed by long-range attacks -- with buildings reduced to mere piles of rubble -- but occupying Russian forces then used some of the houses as their own personnel barracks.  Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr fled when the shelling first began, only to return after the town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1. While their home was seemingly untouched by the heavy shelling that destroyed Borodianka, it was ransacked inside. Clothes and discarded bottles littered the floor. They found their pet bird dead in its cage.  ""Alcohol is everywhere; empty bottles in the hallway, under things,"" the 44-year-old said. ""They (the Russians) smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table. They used the bed linen as their own."" Most of the furniture was either damaged or destroyed, as was their TV.  ""They did everything they wanted,"" Kostychenko said. ""Our jewels were taken away. They're nothing but looters."" Nearby shops have also been pillaged, their windows broken and contents either stolen or splattered over the floors.  The letter ""V,"" short for Vostok (meaning 'east' in Russian) -- and a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military district in concert with the letter ""Z,"" an emblem for Moscow's so-called ""special military operation"" -- was painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints.  The local unemployment office and City Hall were fortified and turned into headquarters for Russian troops stationed in the town. Both were also covered in Vs.  Borodianka was a jumping-off point for Russian units as they advanced on Kyiv through suburbs like Bucha and Irpin. They faced staunch resistance by Ukrainian forces and were forced to retreat. Remains of destroyed Russian hardware in the dozens now litters cities and towns around the capital, and fox holes and artillery positions were left almost untouched. Authorities have imposed a curfew in the entire Kyiv region until April 7, calling on residents to remain indoors while they conduct de-mining operations. Moscow has denied targeting civilians, but volunteers are working with police to pick up the bodies of killed civilians left to rot in the open air.   ""We are gathering people who were shot by the Russians. Civilians who were tortured. We have been working for two days,"" Hennadiy Avramenko, 45, said. CNN watched as Avramenko and his colleague extracted the body of a 44-year-old Ukrainian from a car. He was shot through the heart while driving, with his car crashing into a ditch next to the road. ""Psychologically, it's difficult,"" Avramenko said. ""The worst thing is that we're not finding soldiers, just innocent people. ""They were shot for no reason,"" he added. The volunteers pick up an additional two bodies in the space of an hour. One of them was the charred corpse of a person hit by an artillery round, the other an elderly man who was shot while riding his bicycle.  ""(Monday) we picked up seven people and (by midday Tuesday) we're already at six,"" Avramenko said.   In and around Borodianka, authorities are only now starting to comb through what's left of most buildings, knowing they'll continue to find dead bodies as they do.  Despite the withdrawal of Putin's army from their city, residents of Borodianka fear the destruction it sowed will linger for months, if not years. "
"Bodies tied up, shot and left to rot in Bucha hint at gruesome reality of Russia's occupation in Ukraine","The Russian column of tanks and armored personnel carriers sped along a residential street in Bucha, a tree-lined suburb of the capital Kyiv. That was February 27th.  A short time later, that same line of vehicles lay in ruins, the wreckage smoldering, after being ambushed by Ukrainian forces.   There was no sign of the column's soldiers. In a video showing the destruction, a man could be heard muttering: ""I wish you all to burn in hell.""  But that Ukrainian victory was to be short-lived; a month-long occupation of Bucha by Russian forces followed.  The suburb's name has this week become a byword for war crimes, after accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat, as the Kremlin shifts its focus away from the Ukrainian capital to the country's east.  In recent days, Moscow has claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged -- calling it ""fake,"" and part of a ""planned media campaign."" But witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago.  And the devastation there bears similarities to Russia's playbook in other towns and cities in Ukraine, where officials say civilian infrastructure has come under attack -- with power supplies knocked out, water cut off and communications towers damaged -- making it harder for local residents to hold out against Russian troops. But Ukraine has not surrendered. There have also been reports of looting, disappearances, and evidence of the indiscriminate killings of civilians since the war began.  None Horrors on the road Bucha -- once a magnet for young families due to its affordable homes, green spaces, and good schools -- and other areas nearby, turned into a living nightmare in March as Russian troops stormed the region.  Residents there share difficult to verify stories of looted homes, senseless murders and failed escapes via Kyiv's Zhytomyr highway -- now a graveyard for wrecked tanks and burned-out cars.   In Bucha, pitch-roofed homes crumbled under the force of Russian artillery strikes.  Residents say they had no choice but to turn their vegetable patches and front yards into makeshift graves, since the presence of Russian forces made it impossible to reach the morgue or local cemetery. Anna Bilous, 48, had lived in Bucha for eight years before the Russian troops arrived. She sheltered in her home with her husband and two sons, but around March 4, when the electricity cut out and the pipes ran dry, it became clear they had to leave, she told CNN.  They decided that Bilous and her two sons would flee on foot, heading for the nearby suburb of Irpin on March 9, while her husband stayed behind to care for the family's elderly neighbors.  The trio traveled on side roads to avoid the Russian soldiers, but when they turned onto Yablunska Street, the family was stunned to find dead bodies scattered across the road -- including one lifeless man collapsed under a bicycle.     Bilous believes the man's body remained there for close to a month, until he and some 20 other civilians were photographed for the world to see this past weekend.  Bucha's mayor has described their deaths as an execution.  Bilous' account and satellite images captured on March 18, shared by Maxar Technologies, show that the bodies had lain in the street for weeks, since the town was under Russian control -- Russia held Bucha until March 31.  On Tuesday, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov continued to deny the accusations of brutal civilian killings in Bucha, saying the claims are not only ""groundless, but are a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army."" Reports of executions About a mile away, at a sanatorium in Vokzal'na Street on Monday, Ukrainian officials ushered journalists into a cold basement where the contorted and bloodied bodies of five men lay in an advanced state of decay.  Some of those in this dimly-lit space had been kneecapped. Others, their arms bound behind their backs, had been shot multiple times. Bullet casings littered the ground.  Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, said it was a cruel display of torture and execution by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify his claim.  The men were killed sometime in the last three weeks, officials say. Their bodies are as yet unidentified, since no personal documents have been found.  In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied anyone was harmed.   ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" Officials say Russian forces bedded down in the sanatorium around the second week of March. Several foxholes, trenches, and positions for armored vehicles remain visible around the site; leftover Russian rations have been abandoned nearby.  Soldiers have daubed the exterior walls of the facility with the letter ""V,"" a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military District, and used synonymously with the letter ""Z,"" as an emblem for Russia's ""special military operation.""         The gruesome scene proved too much for Vladislav Minchenko, who vomited after volunteering to help remove the bodies from the basement on Monday. ""This is not what we learned in school,"" said Minchenko, 44, who worked as a painter before the war. Holding up his hands, Minchenko told CNN the number of dead bodies he had dealt with since the start of the conflict numbered in the ""hundreds -- not dozens -- hundreds."" Hasty burials in mass grave  Shelling, live fire, and trigger-happy Russian soldiers made it too dangerous for those injured in the assault on Bucha to seek treatment at the local hospital in the center of town, according to residents.  The local morgue in Bucha ran out of space as deaths mounted in March; to deal with all the bodies, a tractor was brought in to dig a mass grave in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, its abbot, Andriy Galavin told CNN. ""There were too many dead people, and there was no way to properly bury them because getting to the cemetery was simply unrealistic because of the shelling,"" Galavin said.   There was also a lack of resources, such as coffins, due to the main bridge connecting Bucha to Irpin being blown up at the start of the war, Galavin said.     As of this weekend, Kyiv Regional Police and residents believed the remains of at least 150 people had been laid to rest in the grave, but the mayor of Bucha said the death toll could be as high as 300. CNN could not independently verify those claims. Galavin returned to Bucha last week once the town was liberated; he said the plan was to exhume the bodies, identify them via DNA analysis and hopefully provide some solace to relatives still searching for missing loved ones.  None Tip of the iceberg The devastation wrought in Bucha is just the tip of the iceberg, Ukrainian President Zelensky warned on Monday.  ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago,"" President Zelensky said. ""The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this.""  One grisly example of the callous indifference for human life was found in Motyzhyn, a village around 20 miles south of Bucha. The local mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was discovered half-buried in a ditch alongside members of her family. Ukrainian officials said Saturday that she was killed after being captured by Russian forces. And, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says that 11 local mayors are being held by the Russians, which CNN cannot verify.  ""Unfortunately, so far, we have not been able to get in touch or to free any other city mayors and we don't even know, we think that some of them were killed,"" she told CNN, promising that the perpetrators would pay for their crimes against Ukraine. ""We will find them and kill them, and we will punish everyone who killed our city mayors, our journalists, our priests, our activists."" As Ukrainian officials race to clear mines and booby traps left by retreating Russian troops, they fear civilian casualties may be much higher in Borodyanka, 14 miles west of Bucha. Oksana Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr returned home to Borodyanka over the weekend after fleeing the area on February 27. They discovered that their house had been trashed and looted by Russian soldiers. The couple also found a dead man in their backyard. His arms were tied behind his back, and his trousers had been pulled down.  ""Alcohol is everywhere. Empty bottles in the hallway, under things,"" Oksana said. ""They smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table... They lived here as they wished."" Anna Bilous and her sons made it out of Bucha on March 10. But the fate of the dead man they saw lying beneath a bicycle as they fled still haunts her.  ""I feel like me and my sons could be in the same place as the man who died,"" she said. ""I feel the pain and sadness of all these lost people."" "
