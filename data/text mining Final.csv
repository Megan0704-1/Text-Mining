0,5/19/2022,What Is America?ôs Strategy in Ukraine?,"['The Senate passed a $40 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine on Thursday, but with a small group of isolationist Republicans loudly criticizing the spending and the war entering a new and complicated phase, continued bipartisan support is not guaranteed.Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, warned the Senate Armed Services Committee recently that the next few months may be volatile. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia could take ?úa more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory,??she said, with the increased likelihood that Russia could threaten to use nuclear weapons.These are extraordinary costs and serious dangers, and yet there are many questions that President Biden has yet to answer for the American public with regard to the continued involvement of the United States in this conflict.In March, this board argued that the message from the United States and its allies to Ukrainians and Russians alike must be: No matter how long it takes, Ukraine will be free. Ukraine deserves support against Russia?ôs unprovoked aggression, and the United States must lead its NATO allies in demonstrating to Vladimir Putin that the Atlantic alliance is willing and able to resist his revanchist ambitions.', 'That goal cannot shift, but in the end, it is still not in America?ôs best interest to plunge into an all-out war with Russia, even if a negotiated peace may require Ukraine to make some hard decisions. And the U.S. aims and strategy in this war have become harder to discern, as the parameters of the mission appear to have changed.Is the United States, for example, trying to help bring an end to this conflict, through a settlement that would allow for a sovereign Ukraine and some kind of relationship between the United States and Russia? Or is the United States now trying to weaken Russia permanently? Has the administration?ôs goal shifted to destabilizing Vladimir Putin or having him removed? Does the United States intend to hold Mr. Putin accountable as a war criminal? Or is the goal to try to avoid a wider war ??and if so, how does crowing about providing U.S. intelligence to kill Russians and sink one of their ships achieve this?Without clarity on these questions, the White House not only risks losing Americans??interest in supporting Ukrainians ??who continue to suffer the loss of lives and livelihoods ?î\xa0 but also jeopardizes long-term peace and security on the European continent.Americans have been galvanized by Ukraine?ôs suffering, but popular support for a war far from U.S. shores will not continue indefinitely. Inflation is a much bigger issue for American voters than Ukraine, and the disruptions to global food and energy markets are likely to intensify.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe current moment is a messy one in this conflict, which may explain President Biden and his cabinet?ôs reluctance to put down clear goal posts. All the more reason, then, for Mr. Biden to make the case to American voters, well before November, that support for Ukraine means support for democratic values and the right of countries to defend themselves against aggression ??while peace and security remain the ideal outcome in this war.', 'It is tempting to see Ukraine?ôs stunning successes against Russia?ôs aggression as a sign that with sufficient American and European help, Ukraine is close to pushing Russia back to its positions before the invasion. But that is a dangerous assumption.A decisive military victory for Ukraine over Russia, in which Ukraine regains all the territory Russia has seized since 2014, is not a realistic goal. Though Russia?ôs planning and fighting have been surprisingly sloppy, Russia remains too strong, and Mr. Putin has invested too much personal prestige in the invasion to back down.The United States and NATO are already deeply involved, militarily and economically. Unrealistic expectations could draw them ever deeper into a costly, drawn-out war. Russia, however battered and inept, is still capable of inflicting untold destruction on Ukraine and is still a nuclear superpower with an aggrieved, volatile despot who has shown little inclination toward a negotiated settlement. Ukraine and Russia now ?úappear further apart than at any other point in the nearly three-month-long war,??as The Times reported.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyRecent bellicose statements from Washington ??President Biden?ôs assertion that Mr. Putin ?úcannot remain in power,??Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin?ôs comment that Russia must be ?úweakened??and the pledge by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that the United States would support Ukraine ?úuntil victory is won????may be rousing proclamations of support, but they do not bring negotiations any closer.In the end, it is the Ukrainians who must make the hard decisions: They are the ones fighting, dying and losing their homes to Russian aggression, and it is they who must decide what an end to the war might look like. If the conflict does lead to real negotiations, it will be Ukrainian leaders who will have to make the painful territorial decisions that any compromise will demand.The United States and NATO have demonstrated that they will support the Ukrainian fight with ample firepower and other means. And however the fighting ends, the United States and its allies must be prepared to help Ukraine rebuild.But as the war continues, Mr. Biden should also make clear to President Volodymyr Zelensky and his people that there is a limit to how far the United States and NATO will go to confront Russia, and limits to the arms, money and political support they can muster. It is imperative that the Ukrainian government?ôs decisions be based on a realistic assessment of its means and how much more destruction Ukraine can sustain.', 'Confronting this reality may be painful, but it is not appeasement. This is what governments are duty bound to do, not chase after an illusory ?úwin.??Russia will be feeling the pain of isolation and debilitating economic sanctions for years to come, and Mr. Putin will go down in history as a butcher. The challenge now is to shake off the euphoria, stop the taunting and focus on defining and completing the mission. America?ôs support for Ukraine is a test of its place in the world in the 21st century, and Mr. Biden has an opportunity and an obligation to help define what that will be.']","['Avril Haines', 'Putin', 'Lloyd Austin', 'Nancy Pelosi', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Biden']",New York Times
1,4/22/2022,Can Sanctions Really Stop Putin?,"['When Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February, trampling on the sovereignty of a neighbor, international sanctions were the best path forward for the United States and its allies to take. The ruthlessness and grave atrocities toward civilians that have ensued since only reinforce that call.As of this week, those sanctions have made dents in both Russia?ôs economy and its ability to wage war in Ukraine. As foreign companies have withdrawn operations from Russia, Moscow?ôs mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, estimated that some 200,000 people there are at risk of losing their jobs, and there?ôs some evidence that the decision by Europe and the United States to restrict the export of microchips has already affected Russia?ôs ability to produce and repair tanks. The sanctions have also sent a vital message of support to the Ukrainian people.It is undeniable that the United States and its allies were ??and still are ??right to use sanctions to try to end this war.Yet as the Biden administration weighs the next phase of this conflict, Americans should be cleareyed about the limits of what sanctions are likely to achieve.', 'It?ôs too early to know how history will judge this unprecedented, sweeping effort to make Mr. Putin pay a price for his war. Nor can we predict the unintended consequences these sanctions may produce in the coming months or years. But there are lots of indications that the war ??and the sanctions it triggered ??could last a long time. As it is wise to have definite goals and an exit strategy when a country enters a military conflict, the same is true for waging economic warfare.The West has turned to sanctions as a tool with growing frequency since World War II ??in places as varied as South Africa, the Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Iran. It is relatively easy to apply sanctions, and they nearly always satisfy the domestic political need to ?údo something??short of military engagement.Here?ôs the issue: Sanctions historically have not been particularly effective in changing regimes, and their record at changing dictators??behavior is mixed at best.Cuba, Venezuela and North Korea never bowed to American demands. Where there are success stories, they are modest: Crippling sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program, but that regime never stopped asserting its right to enrich uranium. The bite of sanctions eventually contributed to the end of white-minority rule in South Africa, but it was just one of many factors.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOr, to understand the limits of sanctions, Americans might consider our own national experience. When Arab nations imposed an oil embargo on the United States in the 1970s, it caused a lot of pain, but it did not cause the United States to stop supporting Israel.', 'The Biden administration deserves credit for laying the groundwork for multilateral sanctions, which are the only kind that have the hope of success. The greatest effects seen so far from the sanctions have been by unplugging Russia, if only partially, from the international financial system through moves like freezing billions of dollars in assets overseas and taking some Russian banks off SWIFT, the global messaging system for financial transactions. These far-reaching punishments, unthinkable even a few months ago, displayed a new sense of cooperation among the United States and the other Group of 7 countries.Even Mr. Putin acknowledged that they have ?úachieved certain results.??But focusing on helping Ukraine financially and with military equipment might prove more productive than thinking up new sanctions on Russia. The Biden administration appears to recognize this, at least in part, with its latest $800 million in military aid and $500 million in emergency funding announced on Thursday.Sanctions alone ??at least any sanctions that European countries would be willing to now consider ??will not bring Russia to its knees any time soon. As long as Europeans still depend on Russian oil and gas, Russia will be able to depend on significant income from that relationship. The spat over whether gas deliveries will be paid in rubles, as Russia has demanded, only highlights the bind that European countries find themselves in.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe oligarchs who are losing their yachts and the people who are tightening their belts have little sway over the Kremlin. In Russia, with average citizens, Mr. Putin has grist for a loud ?úI told you so??about the West?ôs purported longing to bring down Russia.Will the sanctions imposed by the Group of 7 nations truly isolate Russia? No. A number of countries, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and, most significantly, China, remain on friendly terms with Russia. The fact that this list also includes archrivals Pakistan and India, as well as Iran and Israel, illustrates Mr. Putin?ôs influence as an arms dealer and a power broker in South Asia and the Middle East.The United States could tighten the economic screws on Russia by imposing secondary sanctions. U.S. officials already appear to be threatening as much in meetings and calls with officials in India and China. Secondary sanctions are a powerful tool to compel other countries to get in line with American policy. But the potential benefits need to be weighed against the risks and costs. The extraterritorial application of American laws can also incite deep resentment, even from European allies at times. Secondary sanctions should be used sparingly, and only after consultation with partners.Sanctions can have other unintended consequences as well. They can actually end up strengthening a dictator?ôs grip on power by tightening state control over the economy. Private businesses can have a hard time weathering the storm of sanctions, but authoritarian regimes and their state-owned enterprises often find ways to circumvent them. Sanctions also provide dictators with a credible external enemy to blame for the misery of their people. Instead of pushing people to rise up against their rulers, sanctions often inspire a rally-around-the-flag effect. After Western sanctions were placed on Russia in 2014, in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, 71 percent of Russians saw them as an attempt to ?úweaken and humiliate Russia,??according to an independent poll.', 'It is also worth remembering that, although Russia?ôs invasion proves that economic integration is no cure for war, economic isolation is also not a recipe for peace. Sanctions are often sold as an alternative to war. But they can also be a precursor to war, as seen with the institution of the American oil embargo against Japan and the freezing of Japanese assets about five months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.So, while sanctions can hobble economies, they rarely compel the kinds of wholesale political changes that American officials would like to see. Research has shown that they produced some meaningful changes in behavior about 40 percent of the time. Change is unlikely to occur when sanctions are imposed without communicating the steps that must be taken for them to be rolled back.All the more reason that the United States should have a clear plan for how and under what circumstances it would be appropriate to roll back these latest sanctions. Right now, this has been left deliberately vague to allow the Ukrainians to directly negotiate with Russia. It is laudable to give deference to Ukrainians whose lives are on the line in this terrible war. But creating clear goals and communicating benchmarks for sanctions relief are important factors in successful sanctions. Too often, sanctions are left in place for decades, without evaluation of whether or not they are achieving what they were put in place to do.The United States and its allies have been wise in tightening the economic screws on Russia, so long as they bear no illusions about what this can and cannot achieve.']","['Putin', 'Biden']",New York Times
2,4/6/2022,Document War Crimes in Ukraine (Even if Putin Never Faces Justice),"['The apocalyptic images of bodies sprawled in the mud among twisted tanks, charred walls and splintered trees in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities speak to the brutality of the war that Vladimir Putin started. The knowledge that more such horrors, many more, will be revealed as Russian troops retreat cries out for a reckoning.President Biden called for a war crime trial, and President Emmanuel Macron of France declared there were ?úclear??indications of war crimes. Human Rights Watch reported documented cases of rape and summary executions. Ukrainian and international investigators have already begun collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses. It is imperative that this work be done promptly and scrupulously.It may appear unduly legalistic to parse evidence or to question witnesses as countless civilians cower in their homes hoping against hope that Russian shells don?ôt hit their apartment buildings. The very notion that warfare can have rules, suggesting that there are correct ways to inflict death and destruction on an enemy, is difficult to grasp, and prosecuting commanders carries the risk of appearing as victor?ôs justice.For at least 75 years, the international community has undertaken a real but incomplete effort to define wars of unprovoked aggression as crimes in and of themselves. In the words of the Nuremberg tribunal, ?úTo initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.??, 'In Ukraine, there is no question that Russia is the aggressor, that Bucha, the Ukrainian town that had been occupied by Russian forces for five weeks ??and Mariupol and Kharkiv and Chernihiv and Kyiv and scores of other cities and towns ??would be peacefully greeting spring had Mr. Putin not ordered an unprovoked war to satisfy his ambitions of empire and the destruction of a neighboring nation. Ukraine?ôs resistance is unquestionably self-defense, and the nations of the world are within their rights to impose sanctions on Mr. Putin and his country. Concerned nations are also right to help arm the Ukrainian military, if only to make the price of aggression so high that he, or at least those around him, might come to their senses.Yet the world has also identified crimes that are unacceptable even in the fog of battle. Objectively gathering and documenting evidence is a powerful way to cut through the muck and preserve the possibility that someone might someday be held accountable. It holds out the possibility, however slim, that someday a judge will declare the orders to fire on a village or hospital illegal and that that legal judgment might one day serve as a deterrent in the next war. War crime investigations are a powerful political tool that can be used to underscore the dignity of victims and the lawlessness of the invaders.An array of international criminal laws emerged after World War II, most famously the Geneva Convention of 1949, which aims to hold combatants personally responsible for war crimes ??such as intentionally slaughtering civilians, torture, wanton destruction of property, sexual violence, pillaging, conscripting children. Other measures included the Genocide Convention and laws prohibiting crimes against humanity.The Russian Army?ôs actions give every appearance of violating these rules, and investigations have already begun in the International Criminal Court and some other courts. The indiscriminate shelling of cities and towns, the killings evidenced by the mass graves discovered in Bucha and the bombing of a Mariupol theater are among the many actions that could be deemed war crimes. The entire invasion would appear to be a crime of aggression, which would presumably reach Mr. Putin. If these crimes are determined to be part of a widespread or systematic attack on the civilian population based on a state policy, they could also amount to crimes against humanity.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyRussia, for the record, says the atrocities in Bucha are all staged. And it may well be that investigators will find evidence of atrocities committed by Ukrainian troops against Russians or collaborators. All the more reason to conduct a thorough accounting.', 'Delivering justice ??collecting the evidence, securing an indictment, holding a fair trial ??is hard, time-consuming and expensive. As such, few instances of war crimes lead to punishment. Though the I.C.C. can initiate prosecution on any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime on its own, a charge of the crime of aggression ??the one most applicable to Mr. Putin and his lieutenants ??would have to be initiated by the United Nations Security Council, where it would face a certain Russian veto. In addition, Russia does not recognize the I.C.C. and would not surrender suspects.Ukraine also is not party to the treaty that established the court but has allowed it jurisdiction over crimes committed on Ukrainian soil. The United States, for its part, has its own history of hostility to the I.C.C., and when accusing Mr. Putin of war crimes, Mr. Biden did not make clear what forum should be responsible for prosecution.Yet none of these hurdles should preclude a search for justice. Even if the process is difficult and stretches into months and years, it is important that history be left a forensic, credible, verified and judicially processed record of the specific crimes in Ukraine. Those responsible should be named, their actions specified, and if at all possible, the guilty should be locked away. The very fact that Russia is arguing that the atrocities were all concocted requires a detailed and incontrovertible judicial response.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Biden administration and its allies have done an admirable job of puncturing the Kremlin?ôs propaganda with accurate intelligence. An authoritative record of war crimes would serve the same purpose for the future.It would be good for the Biden administration to find a way to cooperate with the I.C.C. in collecting evidence, even if it is precluded by law from helping to finance the effort. There are other options: A special tribunal could be established without a U.N. endorsement, and several nations, including the United States, could claim universal jurisdiction and hold their own trials. But too many investigations would dilute the public impact of the legal process, and no tribunal carries the authority or mandate of the I.C.C.However it is done, seeking justice against Mr. Putin and others responsible for war crimes in Ukraine is a goal for the longer term. Russia is not retreating. It is repositioning its forces for an assault in the east. And Russia?ôs participation in sputtering peace talks is looking increasingly like a ploy. The horrors of Bucha have prompted talk of offering Ukraine deadlier weapons and imposing yet more sanctions. These must be the focus of the West?ôs efforts to help Ukraine.But it is also imperative to make sure that the horrific evidence of criminal atrocities on display in Bucha and so many other places is promptly collected while it is still there and that witnesses are questioned while their memories are still raw. Posterity must know what really happened. Justice must be given a chance.', 'The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

3,4/1/2022,Putin Knows What He?ôs Doing With Ukraine?ôs Refugees. This Is the World?ôs Big Test.,"['The mass flight of refugees from Ukraine has created a humanitarian crisis that dwarfs anything Europe has seen since World War II. More than four million people have poured into neighboring countries, and as long as Russia?ôs savage war continues, millions more will flee. Already, the flow of refugees from Ukraine is far greater than the number from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq who fled to Europe in 2015, upending European politics.Europe?ôs initial reaction to the flight from Ukraine has been an impressive show of solidarity, given how suddenly the crisis exploded. Refugees, most of whom are women and children, because most men are required to stay behind in Ukraine to fight, have been welcomed and housed even as their numbers swell.But the scale of this crisis is staggering, and it is still in its early stages. Coping with it will demand more coordination, imagination, funds and determination both within Europe and by the United States and allies elsewhere. Existing refugee centers should receive far more assistance, and ways need to be found to encourage refugees to move on to countries that have more capacity to host them. Preparations should also be made now to help Ukrainians return home, should a lasting peace eventually take hold.Opening the doors wide to European refugees raises an inevitable comparison to the treatment of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other countries. About 16,000 people remain in refugee camps in Greece, and many of them are going hungry because they lack the same rights that are being guaranteed to Ukrainians. But the answer to a double standard cannot be to close the doors to Ukrainians.', 'To put it in perspective, close to one million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seek refuge in Europe in one year, 2015. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, nearly one million people have left Ukraine every week. Barring a peace agreement, Russia will keep bombarding civilian infrastructure. Ukraine will keep fighting for its survival. Ten million people ??roughly a quarter of the population of Ukraine ??could end up leaving the country in the coming months.Cities in Poland, Moldova and Romania have been transformed, putting pressure on schools, housing, hospitals and government assistance programs. Warsaw, a city of about 1.6 million people, is now hosting more than 300,000 Ukrainian refugees, many of whom are sleeping in hastily set up welcome centers. Overcrowded shelters for women and children are targets for human trafficking and criminal exploitation.Refugees are not a design flaw of Vladimir Putin?ôs war in Ukraine. Indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian infrastructure is part of a broader strategy to demoralize the civilian population and drive residents into neighboring countries, where their presence can be destabilizing. This became clear during last year?ôs episode on the Belarus-Poland border, after Aleksandr Lukashenko, the autocratic ruler of Belarus, apparently manufactured a crisis by encouraging migrants to cross into Poland.Over time, resentment of Ukrainian refugees may grow. People who started off welcoming the refugees could turn against them, putting pressure on their governments to force Ukraine to end the war on Russia?ôs terms. Easing this pressure, by supporting the countries that are hosting refugees, makes this tactic of trying to weaponize refugees less effective.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Council of the European Union has already taken an important step by passing a directive that grants temporary protected status to Ukrainian nationals and certain legal permanent residents of Ukraine for up to one year. Most Ukrainians already had the right to travel without visas to European Union countries for 90 days. The new measure gives them the right to live, work and attend school in E.U. countries without having to go through the official process of seeking asylum.', 'But far more needs to be done to assist the places where refugees are clustered, and to help refugees find their way out of overcrowded welcome centers. Britain?ôs ?úHomes for Ukraine??program, which pays families and organizations to take in refugees, has resulted in the issuing of 2,700 visas so far, while Finland has offered spots in universities to 2,000 Ukrainians.These ad hoc efforts are important but insufficient given the millions of people who are affected. The European Union has established a platform to match offers of help with those in need. Seven countries, including Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, have pledged to take in some 15,000 of the Ukrainians now in Moldova. But that?ôs a small fraction of the estimated 98,000 Ukrainians in Moldova, many of whom are reluctant to leave because a language they know, Russian, is spoken there.The European Union has also identified roughly 17 billion euros in funds for pandemic recovery and programs to promote social and economic cohesion that could be immediately spent on urgent needs, including housing, education, health care and child care. An E.U. proposal to address the current crisis would distribute more of those funds to countries hosting large numbers of refugees. Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia would receive 45 percent more funding than they would have gotten. Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Estonia ??member states that have received the highest number of Ukrainians in proportion to their national populations ??would get that increase as well.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEfforts to humanely accommodate those displaced by the war need not be confined to Europe. Canada, which is home to a large Ukrainian population, has agreed to welcome an unlimited number of people fleeing the war to stay for up to three years. Even Japan, which has long been reluctant to take in refugees, has agreed to accept Ukrainians.President Biden?ôs announcement that the United States would accept up to 100,000 is a good start, but the country can do more, especially when public support for welcoming Ukrainian refugees is strong. The United States has been a key player in Ukraine over the years, from encouraging Ukrainians to stand up to Russia to persuading Ukrainians to agree to the removal of nuclear weapons from their territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union, a decision that many Ukrainians deeply regret today.As the world enters a period of greater instability, its leaders can no longer ignore the need for a coordinated and humane response to all of those fleeing war and other desperate circumstances.', 'The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

4,3/11/2022,Will Sanctions on Russia Help Ukraine?,"['As his ruthless invasion continues, Vladimir Putin is trying to break Ukraine by demolishing its cities and brutalizing its people. Each day brings fresh horrors. A family killed while crossing a bridge to safety. Fathers and children touching hands and parting. A maternity hospital blasted into pieces in Mariupol, where roughly half a million people are under siege.The United States, the European Union and other countries, including Australia and Switzerland, have responded by imposing economic sanctions on Russia with a severity that has few parallels among nations not at war. On Friday the Biden administration added to those sanctions by announcing that the United States would join the European Union and other allies in moving to suspend permanent normal trade relations with Russia, which would put it in the company of Cuba and North Korea. Corporations are fleeing, too. McDonald?ôs first Moscow restaurant, opened in 1990, was a powerful symbol of Russia?ôs openness to the West. On Tuesday, McDonald?ôs temporarily closed all of its nearly 850 restaurants in the country.The sanctions are raising the price of Russia?ôs belligerence and can degrade its capacity to pursue this campaign of terror, or others, by cutting off access to raw materials and supplies.But there is danger in relying on sanctions to satiate public fury. While symbolic gestures like impounding yachts have their place, Western nations must be careful not to punish individuals who have nothing to do with Mr. Putin?ôs war, as in Lithuania?ôs decision last week to cancel a donation of Covid-19 vaccines to Bangladesh after that nation abstained from a United Nations vote on a resolution to condemn Russia. There is also good reason to wait and see the effect of measures imposed so far before going further. Russia is already facing a devastating economic crisis from the sanctions in place now.', 'Policymakers are wrestling with two questions that don?ôt necessarily have the same answer: What can be done to help Ukraine? And what kind of relationship should Western nations maintain with an increasingly belligerent Russia?To help Ukraine, the United States has provided weapons and economic assistance, and Congress on Thursday approved $13.6 billion in additional aid. Despite Russia?ôs horrific targeting of civilians, the Biden administration has wisely emphasized the need for military restraint, rejecting calls to enforce a no-fly zone above Ukraine. Such a policy would be tantamount to a declaration of war against another nuclear power, because it could require the United States to shoot down Russian planes over Ukraine. America can best avoid worsening this terrible conflict by making clear that it will honor commitments to its NATO allies but refrain from direct military engagement in Ukraine.Similar care is needed in the realm of economic policy. Sanctions are most likely to help Ukraine if demands and terms for lifting those sanctions are clearly communicated to Russia. Mr. Putin has portrayed Western sanctions as an unprovoked move to destroy the Russian economy; there is little benefit to feeding the view that he is being unfairly persecuted. Clear goals can also help Western governments maintain public support for policies that are likely to impose economic pain on their own citizens. And clarity will help to maintain a coordinated international response, which is likely to become more challenging the longer the conflict continues.Beyond the imperative to respond to Mr. Putin?ôs aggression, this conflict has also clarified the need for America and Europe to loosen the economic ties with Russia that were so carefully built over the past three decades. Economic relationships should fall more closely in line with other national priorities. Europe, in particular, is confronting the grim reality that its dependence on Russian gas means that it is funding Mr. Putin?ôs war.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImmediate steps to reduce dependence on Russia are likely to rest heavily on other sources of carbon-based fuel. But nations regretting their reliance on Putin?ôs Russia can simultaneously pursue a shift away from dependence on any petrostates by accelerating the development of renewable energy sources. The Washington Post reports that White House officials have explored a plan to manufacture energy-efficient heat pumps for European households, which could help reduce Europe?ôs use of Russian natural gas by about 2 billion cubic meters over the next year. Even if the impact is relatively small, about 4 percent of a goal set by the International Energy Agency, that kind of idea is worth pursuing as a meaningful contribution to the security of European nations and the United States.', 'At the same time, Western nations should carefully consider the value of policies that restrict ordinary Russians??access to the opportunities available to those who participate in an interconnected global economy.Mr. Putin?ôs savage invasion of Ukraine has shattered the post-Cold War project of interlacing Russia with the democratic nations of Europe. As the West once again finds itself pitted against Russia, it is worth remembering that the Cold War was won by those who took better care of their own people and held out the prospect of a better life to those on the other side of the divide.', 'The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5,3/4/2022,Ukraine?ôs President Zelensky Is Showing the World How to Resist Putin,"['As Russia?ôs leader holds his ground in his invasion of Ukraine, increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, the leadership of the United States and its European allies becomes ever more essential.The harsh, immediate and wide-ranging sanctions ordered after the invasion ??including a freeze on Russian funds abroad and on the assets of its central bank, bans on dealings with several major Russian banks, restrictions on Russian flights to the West and personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin and some of his senior lieutenants ??were appropriate. While these sanctions have not persuaded Russia to stop, they have demonstrated that there are consequences for unprovoked wars of aggression. The ruble tanked, the Russian stock market plunged, and Russians lined up at A.T.M.s to withdraw money. Mr. Putin vented his frustration by putting Russia?ôs nuclear forces on a heightened alert.Mr. Putin?ôs readiness to invoke nuclear weapons and attack a nuclear power plant added another fearful dimension to his aggression. But President Biden wisely refused to escalate, canceled a planned missile test and repeated that the United States has not pledged to defend Ukraine with troops.Some of Europe?ôs leaders have also risen to the challenge. Germany?ôs new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, reversed decades of German policy and tradition, sharply boosting military spending and rearming itself to counter Russia?ôs menace. Hungary?ôs Viktor Orban, a fan of Mr. Putin, nevertheless joined much of Europe in condemning what he called Russia?ôs ?úmilitary action.??Finland, which had long accepted that its survival depended on deference to Russia, declared that it would send weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. Even Switzerland, that bastion of neutrality and keeper of secrets, announced it would freeze Russian financial assets.', 'All of this, of course, represented Europe?ôs best effort to live up to the example set by Volodymyr Zelensky, the 44-year-old president of Ukraine. Exhausted, unshaven and defiant, he has shown us the face of heroic resistance. In an address to his country on Thursday, he said, ?úI don?ôt want Ukraine?ôs history to be a legend about 300 Spartans. I want peace.?ùOn the battlefield, the invasion force Mr. Putin built over several months along Ukraine?ôs borders on the flimsy pretext of the modernization of Russian forces ran into unexpected resistance from regular and irregular Ukrainian forces. While casualty figures are difficult to verify, one American official estimated that Russian losses are more than 2,000 ??possibly the same as Ukrainian casualties.This first phase of resistance is unlikely to last long, however, making it imperative that the world continue to coalesce around the same message to Ukrainians and Russians alike: No matter how long it takes, Ukraine will be free.The Biden administration and its allies have an opening to speak directly to the stunned people of Russia and say plainly that their president is destroying their future and lying to them about the goals of his war. Mr. Putin is well aware that his support in the Russian public is brittle and could crumble if his lies are exposed. Already, thousands of Russians have been arrested for demonstrating against the war, and two leading liberal media outlets, Echo of Moscow and TV Rain, have been all but silenced. Weakening public support for Mr. Putin may not force him to retreat from Ukraine, but it could raise questions in his entourage about his future.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe obscenely wealthy Russian oligarchs also may not have sway over Mr. Putin?ôs actions. But if they lose their London townhouses and swollen bank accounts and confront the possibility of criminal prosecution in the United States, as Mr. Biden promised, others in Russia?ôs kleptocracy might begin to wonder whether Mr. Putin is a liability.', 'One way to reinforce this message is for the White House to continue sharing its intelligence on the doings in the Kremlin. Predicting every move Putin made before the invasion has, so far, been an effective strategy. It allowed the world to see the full hypocrisy of his scheme, has strengthened unity in the United States and Europe and is opening eyes in Russia. And it might create a healthy element of paranoia in the Kremlin.European countries dependent on Russian oil and gas, Germany first among them, have to start preparing for a future as independent of Russia as possible. Germany has suspended certification of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline; the next step must be to rapidly expand facilities for handling liquefied natural gas and alternate sources of energy. This would be a good moment for Mr. Scholz to reopen the case in Germany for nuclear power and for continuing to operate its remaining nuclear power plants.And both Europe and the United States must re-evaluate their relations with China, a far more important economic partner than Russia. A similar breakdown in America?ôs relationship with China is not inevitable. While significant issues divide the two nations, China?ôs foreign minister, Wang Yi, spoke publicly recently about the potential for cooperation with the United States on global infrastructure projects. After issuing a 5,000-word declaration of friendship with Russia weeks before the invasion and amplifying Russian misinformation, the Chinese government may now be trying to put some distance between itself and the Russian war of choice.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAt home, the Biden administration should stop reassuring the American public that our nation will pay little to no cost for this conflict. For one, while it is clear that Mr. Putin?ôs current aim is to take over all of Ukraine, his erratic behavior makes it impossible to predict his next move. If he took military action against Poland or the Baltic States, the United States would have to honor its pledge to defend its NATO allies.More immediately, while the U.S. government is right to combat inflation and a rapid rise in prices, the administration?ôs duty is to warn that standing up to Mr. Putin may well contribute to higher prices and that Americans should be prepared to accept a measure of sacrifice as part of the free, democratic, interconnected world. It is not too late to sound that call.In the near term, the need to support Ukraine ??short of putting Western boots on the ground there ??is obvious, and much of the world has responded. But one week after the invasion began, Russian forces had seized the strategic port city of Kherson in the south; a roughly 40-mile line of military vehicles stood poised to move on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital; and Russian forces were encircling the northeastern city of Kharkiv. More than a million Ukrainians have already crossed Ukraine?ôs borders, creating an epic humanitarian challenge. Many more may be displaced internally.Whatever new order might emerge from this terrible war and the likely occupation of Ukraine, it is the duty of all leaders to prepare their countries for it, even if the pain it will cause is still unknown.']","['Putin', 'Viktor Orban', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Biden']",New York Times
6,2/24/2022,Mr. Putin Launches a Sequel to the Cold War,"['Vladimir Putin?ôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine is advancing from the east, the south and toward Kyiv in the north. As fighting raged on Thursday, President Biden ordered a harsh round of sanctions, and a fateful new East-West struggle is underway with no indication of where it might lead or how long it might last.It is imperative to state clearly that none of the pretext for war that Mr. Putin churned out in recent days and weeks contained much truth or any justification whatsoever for waging war on a weaker neighbor. This is a war of choice for all the wrong reasons, and Mr. Putin and his coterie are solely and fully responsible for every drop of Ukrainian ??and Russian ??blood, for every livelihood destroyed and for all the economic pain engendered by this conflict.It is also important to acknowledge that no one, save possibly Mr. Putin, has any idea what will happen in coming days, weeks, months and possibly even years. The Russian president said he had no intention of occupying Ukraine, yet he intends to oust its leadership and round up his enemies. But what does that mean? How did he intend to plant a puppet regime without seizing Kyiv, or to kidnap people without taking the whole country? How long does he intend to occupy the country?Does the United States or its allies and friends have the levers, and the will, to punish Russia sufficiently to stymie Mr. Putin?ôs ambitions? In announcing new sanctions, trade restrictions and measures against Russian oligarchs, Mr. Biden said they would impose ?úsevere costs??on the Russian economy ?úboth immediately and over time.??But while a serious fall in the Russian currency and stock market suggest this could be so, the sanctions also demonstrated the limitations of what the West has done so far.', 'Mr. Biden announced sanctions on several large Russian banks, major state-owned enterprises and Mr. Putin?ôs lieutenants, and restrictions on high-tech exports to Russia. Those had all been threatened over many weeks. That the threat failed to deter Mr. Putin indicates that he was prepared to absorb the costs, and to wait and see whether the West could do the same.Mr. Biden stopped short of two especially tough punishments ??personal sanctions against Mr. Putin and excluding Russia from the SWIFT system of global money transfers. The latter in particular would do immediate and grave damage to the Russian economy. But it would also damage the countries with which it trades, including the European Union members and the United States. Mr. Biden said that all such sanctions remained on the table.The president also effectively acknowledged that the sanctions would further increase energy costs for Americans at a time of steep inflation. He said the administration would do what it could to bring down oil and gas prices and warned American energy companies against profiteering.Mr. Biden insisted that the United States and its allies and partners were in full accord on the response to Moscow, and for now there were no evident holdouts. Even Hungary?ôs prime minister, Viktor Orban, an unabashed fan of Mr. Putin, fell in line with E.U. sanctions.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIt is less certain whether a politically divided American public will support Mr. Biden if, for instance, gas prices skyrocket. In keeping with his inexplicable fawning over Mr. Putin while he was president, Donald Trump issued more outrageous appreciation of the Russian?ôs actions even as the invasion was about to start, saying, ?úHe?ôs taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions. I?ôd say that?ôs pretty smart.??, 'Among many other questions around the invasion was the reaction of the Russian public. Thousands of Russians courageously took to the streets in Moscow and other cities on Thursday to protest the war and were met with a fierce police crackdown. How deep the resistance goes, or what it could achieve against Mr. Putin?ôs authoritarian rule, is unclear. It is also not known whether the antiwar outpouring had any tacit sympathy in the upper echelons of government.There is also the matter of how the Chinese government may respond. The world inadvertently caught a glimpse when official guidance to the media on how to treat the Russian invasion was briefly posted online. A senior editor at Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, wrote on social media that China has to give Russia emotional and moral support but to refrain from ?útreading on the toes??of the United States and the E.U. In the future, the editor added revealingly, China will need Russia?ôs support on Taiwan, the independent island-state Beijing is determined to bring under its control.These and other questions were certain to foment debate as the invasion unfolded. What is clear now is that Mr. Putin has thrust Europe into the most dangerous conflict since World War II, acting on a combination of misguided grievances, flawed history and illusions of grandeur. He has launched a sequel to the Cold War, a potentially more dangerous one because his claims and demands offer no grounds for negotiations, and because along with its nuclear arsenal Russia is capable of launching a massively destructive cyberwar.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Biden and other Western leaders are justified in saying they did all they could to try to deter Mr. Putin, meeting with him many times and searching for ways to meet his demands in ways that would not clash with their obligations and principles. But this is just the beginning: In coming days and weeks as Ukrainians fight for their lives, the West will also be sorely tested, and its leaders will need the utmost flexibility and strength to persevere and to guide their publics.In his two televised addresses this week, Mr. Biden displayed the resolution and calm of a tested leader, and the Western alliance demonstrated a rare unity in the face of Russia?ôs attack. The West is strongest when it stands together for its shared values and against a common enemy. However difficult it may be, our pain will be nothing compared with the agonies of the Ukrainian people at the hands of an invading army.', 'The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

7,2/23/2022,No Justification for a Brazen Invasion,"['Explosions were reported in cities across Ukraine early Thursday morning after President Vladimir Putin of Russia vowed in a speech to ?údemilitarize??the neighboring nation, and any hope for a peaceful resolution to the crisis appeared all but snuffed out. On Wednesday, Ukraine declared a 30-day state of emergency, called up military reserves and warned its citizens to leave Russia. The European Union announced it was preparing to handle a large influx of refugees uprooted by war. Financial markets are bracing for the turmoil that a land war and sanctions could unleash across the global economy.As the cause of all of this, Vladimir Putin is giving a master class in dangerous and destructive leadership and making it all the more important that President Biden and other nations stand resolutely together in the face of threats, feints and misinformation and remain disciplined and energized in confronting Mr. Putin. He is clearly playing a long game, and the West should continue to prepare for that and make clear, as Mr. Biden has done, that the Russian president is acting unacceptably and will pay consequences for his actions.The scope of Mr. Putin?ôs professed ambition is alarming and bewildering for much of the world. As Mr. Biden asked, ?úWho in the Lord?ôs name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors??ùAll this makes clear that Mr. Putin?ôs attack is not primarily about NATO or security. It?ôs all about his xenophobic, imperial and misguided notion that Ukraine was inherently an appendage of Russia, its independence a historical fluke and its rulers usurpers. His recognition of separatist states in Ukraine extended not only to enclaves controlled by pro-Russian forces but also to entire provinces, amounting to a major chunk of Ukrainian territory that includes the important port of Mariupol.', 'The magnitude of the Russian gambit is staggering. Whatever Mr. Putin?ôs ideas on how Ukraine should relate to Russia, whatever his grievances over Western encroachment on what he perceives as Russia?ôs sphere of influence, whatever his views on Russia?ôs place in Europe and the world, an unprovoked invasion of a sovereign European state is an unprovoked declaration of war on a scale, on a continent and in a century when it was thought to be no longer possible.If nothing else, Mr. Putin should consider what this means for his people, to whom he has lied, day after day, about purported threats and slights from Ukraine and the West. There will be body bags coming home to Russia and economic dislocation and global ostracism for a nation that has suffered terribly over the past century from war and totalitarian rule.Mr. Biden, for his part, has managed this crisis with toughness, patience, resolve and dignity, revealing regularly what American intelligence knew about Mr. Putin?ôs schemes. It was a novel approach to crisis management in the age of social media and probably helped harden European resolve during the ambiguous monthslong buildup of Russian forces. Mr. Putin should see that this is the resolute face of the world?ôs premier democracy and most powerful nation.Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a meeting scheduled for this week with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. In a letter to Mr. Lavrov, Mr. Blinken said that diplomatic offramps exist ?úif Russia is prepared to take demonstrable steps to provide the international community with any degree of confidence it?ôs serious about de-escalating and finding a diplomatic solution.?ùAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Biden and America?ôs NATO allies have properly declared going to war with Russia over Ukraine unthinkable. Ukraine, far weaker militarily than Russia, will have to bear the brunt of the attack alone, though, as Mr. Biden warned, the sanctions against Russia will have far-reaching economic costs for Europe and the United States, starting with an inevitable increase in the cost of energy.', 'Mr. Biden was right not to unleash the full arsenal of sanctions yet. As long as there is the slightest chance of deterring a full-scale invasion, he and his allies and partners must retain sticks and carrots, however few remain. That could include declaring Mr. Putin and his lieutenants war criminals, subject to arrest anywhere outside Russia. Many more banks can be added to the few that have been barred from the global financial system; trade in a broad array of technologies needed by Russian industry can be banned.These sanctions will also hurt the West, especially Germany, and Russia may well retaliate through cyberattacks or other means that could shake global energy markets. Any such costs should be weighed against the gravity of what Russia has done.Analysts and historians will long debate whether Mr. Putin?ôs grievances had bases in fact, whether the United States and its allies were too cavalier in expanding NATO, whether Russia was justified in believing that its security was compromised. There will also be heated questioning over whether Mr. Biden and other Western leaders could have done more to assuage Mr. Putin.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut no, there is absolutely no justification for a brazen invasion of a weaker neighbor. To answer Mr. Biden?ôs anguished question, nobody and nothing have given Mr. Putin the right to seize territory or decide the fate of neighboring nations. The consequences of his aggression will be terrible for Ukraine and painful for the West and will exact a huge cost on Russia in lives and stunted development. For all this, Mr. Putin carries the full responsibility.', 'The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

8,2/21/2022,A Pointed Response to Putin?ôs Provocations Against Ukraine,"['Vladimir Putin?ôs bewildering aggression toward Ukraine took an ominous turn on Monday when he recognized the independence of two breakaway Ukrainian enclaves and ordered Russian troops into them as ?úpeacekeepers.??The actions were accompanied by a new gush of concocted history depicting Ukraine as entirely a creation of Bolsheviks who were desperate to bolster their cause.President Biden promptly condemned the actions and ordered sanctions against the two separatist regions. But he wisely desisted from firing the full fusillade of punitive measures he has threatened should Mr. Putin unleash the invasion he has prepared by massing Russian forces on all sides of Ukraine, including some in southern Belarus only about 140 miles from the capital, Kyiv. The possibility of deterring the threat of full-bore invasion through diplomacy simply cannot be abandoned so long as it has the slightest chance.Though hawks like Senator Lindsey Graham are demanding crushing sanctions now, the potent punishment threatened by the United States and NATO ??which is likely to include severely limiting financial transactions with major Russian banks; restricting the sale of technologies needed by Russian industries; closing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline; and personal sanctions on Mr. Putin and his lieutenants ??would become useless as a deterrent once ordered, making a full invasion more likely.Recognizing the separatists in the ?úpeople?ôs republics??of Donetsk and Luhansk is not tantamount to that invasion. The separatists control only partial zones of the provinces they claim, and their enclaves have been under effective Russian control since the low-intensity conflict erupted in 2014.', 'Yet the spectacle Mr. Putin choreographed around his speech, including a meeting of his Security Council at which his lieutenants took turns making the argument to recognize the separatists, and the evacuation over the weekend of thousands of residents from the two regions in response to claimed bombardments by Ukraine, were actions clearly intended to convince Russians that they were being drawn into a conflict imposed on them by Ukrainian nationalists and manipulated by the United States and NATO.Mr. Putin?ôs elaborate and grievance-filled riff on Soviet-Ukrainian history was another effort to persuade Russians that their nation has a legitimate historical claim to Ukraine, a theme that has become something of an obsession with the Russian president. In this installment, he argued that Ukraine was created as a separate republic by Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, to support the Bolshevik cause. That purportedly showed that Ukraine is somehow not a real state, though many a country has been formed in the breakup of empires, including, for example, the United States.However flawed Mr. Putin?ôs history lesson, it added yet another degree of threat to the estimated 190,000 troops poised for action on and around Ukraine?ôs borders. And if Mr. Putin were to claim the whole of the oblasts, or provinces, of Donetsk and Luhansk as belonging to the ?úpeople?ôs republics,??and not just the enclaves now controlled by separatists, he would effectively strip a large and strategic area from Ukraine, including the important port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.Since starting the military buildup around Ukraine, Mr. Putin has issued a broad set of grievances and demands, effectively claiming that the United States and its allies reneged on a promise not to expand NATO to Russia?ôs borders, and demanding that the alliance stay out of Ukraine and pull back from Eastern Europe.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThere are areas in which the West can reassure Mr. Putin, as the Biden administration has tried to do without surrendering core principles of the alliance or making decisions over the head of Ukraine. But nothing even remotely justifies invasion. Mr. Putin, however, has dismissed these efforts and has continued to ratchet up tensions.', 'That all this is happening in Europe in 2022, nearly eight decades since the end of World War II and more than three decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is astounding. Though it was inevitable that a vast empire like the Soviet Union would not collapse without aftershocks, and these have regularly broken out in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Europe ??including Russia?ôs annexation of Crimea ??the notion of a vast seizure of territory in Europe via a full-scale war had seemed no longer possible.Yet over his many years in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin seemed to nurture an ever stronger grievance over Russia?ôs, and his own, treatment in the West. And at some point last year, with his personal power effectively secured for the rest of his life, with the United States bitterly divided and seemingly tired of foreign wars, with NATO seemingly at odds, Mr. Putin evidently decided it was time to spread his rule over territories he convinced himself belonged to Russia.What his calculations have evidently missed is that, whatever their history with Russia, Ukrainians have demonstrated no interest in getting under Moscow?ôs roof again. And the more Mr. Putin bullies them, the more strongly Ukrainians come to identify as Ukrainians.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Putin also seemed to overlook that Western democracies and the Western alliance, whatever their problems, remained capable of uniting against a common threat, and of joining together to threaten him and his country with debilitating economic and social damage. The White House has also done a good job of disclosing what its intelligence is gleaning about Russia?ôs tactics and intentions, repeatedly underscoring the cynicism of Russia?ôs claims.The showdown is far from over. There are more feints Russia could make short of sending tanks across the border, including the sort of trouble it?ôs creating in eastern Ukraine or cyberattacks, like the one Western officials believe it recently made against Ukrainian banks.Mr. Biden and his allies and partners have been right not to overreact, and to continuously offer Mr. Putin an exit strategy. High-level meetings have been scheduled; Mr. Biden has expressed readiness to meet Mr. Putin again; the leaders of Germany and France are in constant contact with him.A wary patience at this point is not the same as appeasement, of which the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the West. Whatever Mr. Putin?ôs end game, his moves for now seek to prod and provoke Ukraine and its Western friends into just the kind of overreaction the hawks advocate. There is no justification for Russia?ôs recognition of the two comical ?úpeople?ôs republics,??an action as illegal as it is outrageous, but the cataclysm that would befall Ukraine and Europe in the event of a full invasion warrants continuing to give diplomacy a chance.', 'The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In Bucha alone, according to its mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, the bodies of more than 270 local residents were found in two mass graves discovered after Ukrainian forces moved back into the town. Some victims had their hands tied behind their backs. At least one body on the street seen by reporters was that of a child. The bodies of several women were found naked.', 'Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky himself, have asserted that retreating Russian forces have left behind landmines and may well have booby-trapped some of those civilian bodies.', 'NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described it as ?úbrutality against civilians we haven?ôt seen in Europe for decades.??, 'So how does the world stop this horror?', 'Supplying the Ukrainians with the arms they need so that they can continue their brave battle against Russian forces must remain at the top of the to-do list for the United States and the international community. There can be no halfway measures now. The world ??and yes, the United States as well ??was late to the realization that it was no longer dealing with a rational actor in Vladimir Putin, whose brutality it vastly underestimated.', 'But stopping the Russian war machine is also key. And that means depriving it of the lifeline that Russia?ôs oil and gas supplies have continued to provide. Within the European Union, however, that remains controversial.

15,3/29/2022,Ukraine war poses a challenge for Europe?ôs right-wing populists ??and ours,"['When a country realizes it could be invaded at almost any time, that possibility focuses its mind wonderfully. That?ôs certainly been the case for Poland, where the country?ôs right-wing government ??which until recently was obsessed with gay rights and other culture-wars divides ?îsuddenly seems to have decided that gay pride may not actually be so bad compared with, say, nuclear war.', 'The cause of that shift, of course, has been the unprovoked Russian invasion of Poland?ôs neighbor, Ukraine, and the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin about expanding the war to Poland, the Baltics, and elsewhere. Across Europe, the outbreak of war has been an abrupt, overdue reality check for populist politicians like Poland?ôs president, Andrzej Duda. As much as those leaders may love taking cheap shots at the European Union and other liberal institutions, the peace, security, and prosperity those collective democratic institutions have provided since the end of the Cold War is suddenly nothing to take for granted.', 'Or, as one former US ambassador to Poland put it, ?úThey?ôre starting to say, ?òIf we?ôre going to fight Putin?ôs influence in the name of Europe and democracy, then we have to start to embrace Europe and democracy.????, 'Indeed, the Ukraine war could prove a watershed moment for European politics, reminding governments and voters why past generations built those multilateral institutions and reviving what used to be widespread political support for European integration. For the United States, which has increasingly carried the burden of paying for NATO, that would be a welcome change.', 'European elections this spring provide a first chance to turn the tide against the populists. Hungary?ôs voters go to the polls next week to decide whether to keep Viktor Orban, the country?ôs EU-bashing leader. In France, the presidential election later in April will probably pit incumbent centrist Emmanuel Macron against nationalist Marine Le Pen, who opposes French membership in NATO and previously has called for France to leave the EU as well.', 'In the years before the invasion, Putin shrewdly helped anti-EU, anti-NATO politicians; a Russian bank even loaned money to Le Pen?ôs party, and Russian hackers helped Donald Trump?ôs 2016 election bid in the United States. The Russians tried to inflame social divisions ??over gay rights, race, and other hot-button topics ??to sow division in the West. Now the invasion has put the continent?ôs right-wing parties on the defensive.

As much as Europeans themselves may treat the EU like a political punching bag, the multinational body retains its stature as a powerful enough symbol of freedom and prosperity to inspire Ukrainians to fight and die for their ?úEuropean future.??The horrible sacrifices Ukraine is making to align itself with Europe?ôs institutions ought to be the best rejoinders to the small-minded politicians who would tear them apart.']","['Marine Le Pen', 'Milos Zeman', 'Putin', 'Viktor Orban', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Donald Trump', 'Andrzej Duda']",The Boston Globe
16,3/21/2022,What can the US do to roll out the welcome mat for Ukrainian refugees?,"['The pace at which Ukrainian refugees are fleeing their country due to the Russian invasion has been astonishing. In less than a month, roughly 3 million Ukrainians have left, mainly to neighboring countries in the European Union. In a heart-wrenching statistic, UNICEF estimates that a Ukrainian child has become a refugee almost every single second since the war began.', 'The willingness of the international community to help in the face of such humanitarian disaster has been impressive. Even European countries that have been previously hostile to refugees from Syria and African countries ??looking at you, Poland ??are opening up their hearts and homes to host Ukrainians who are fleeing.', 'Americans also want to do their part. To that end, the Biden administration should launch a private sponsorship program to allow ordinary citizens to host refugees, similar to what Britain, Ireland, and Canada already offer. There are doubtlessly many Americans ready to welcome and provide initial support to newly arrived refugees.', 'By most accounts, though, the US government has not done everything it can to help Ukrainians fleeing the war. As beleaguered and floundering as our immigration system currently is, there are policies that the Biden administration can institute on the margins, such as issuing humanitarian parole visas to Ukrainians that would allow them to remain here for two years.', 'But even when the US refugee resettlement system is working without delays and at full capacity, which is not the case now, that program is not designed to provide immediate relief in times of fast-developing emergencies. To begin with, the application and vetting process for refugees takes about two years. And in the case of Ukrainian refugees, the vast majority may not even be thinking of leaving Europe just yet unless they have family members in the United States. While the situation in Europe remains in flux, the Biden administration should continue rebuilding the resettlement infrastructure that was so badly and cruelly decimated during the Trump years, along with creating a private sponsorship program.', 'Some forms of community sponsorship models have been in place in the United States. For instance, there are ?úsponsor circles??for Afghan refugees. They are part of a resettlement effort led by a group of people who together raise money to pay for the initial resettlement cost and have to undergo training and pass background checks themselves. The sponsor circles program has helped welcome roughly 74,000 Afghans. A similar model should be used for Ukrainians.', 'As for private sponsorship, refugee advocates and experts expect a pilot program to be in place by the end of the year.', '?úThe program will require certain infrastructure, both in terms of overseeing the processing of cases and what happens on the domestic side with sponsors,??said Elizabeth Foydel, private sponsorship program director at the International Refugee Assistance Project. ?úThat takes time to design and fund.??, 'The program, Foydel said, will let Americans step up in times of emergencies and crises like Ukraine, while at the same time allowing the public to engage meaningfully with their new neighbors.', 'And then there are truly novel programs happening elsewhere that the Biden administration should pay attention to as it looks to welcome and integrate refugees. Consider Ireland?ôs example: The government there, which is expecting an influx of up to 100,000 Ukrainian citizens, announced that Ukrainian refugees who are teachers will be fast-tracked so they can be deployed to teach in the classroom.', 'Today, it is Ukrainian and Afghan refugees who are forced to flee.

That?ôs a mistake. With Russia unleashing a punishing bombing campaign from above, Ukraine needs every opportunity to protect its people below.', 'The most-discussed plan involves shipping Polish MIGs to Ukraine, and then replenishing Poland?ôs fleet with American-made fighter jets. Just a week-and-a-half ago, in an interview on CBS?ôs ?úFace the Nation,??Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was giving the ?úgreen light??to the idea.', 'But within days, the administration had backtracked, arguing that the transfer could cross a line with Russian President Vladimir Putin and spark a broader conflict with the West.', 'It?ôs not a very convincing argument.', 'The United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have already supplied the Ukrainian military with an enormously lethal arsenal of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles. They?ôve sent helicopters, patrol boats, and other vehicles. And on Wednesday, after Zelensky?ôs speech, President Biden announced that drones and a new cache of machine guns and grenade launchers are on the way.', 'Every intervention brings sharp condemnation from Moscow; a Kremlin spokesman recently called the sanctions levied on Russia an ?úeconomic war.??But Putin has shown no interest in a wider war. Indeed, with his economy in shambles and his military engaged in an unexpectedly difficult fight with the Ukrainians, a full-on clash with NATO is all but unthinkable at this stage.', 'If the risk of transferring the MIGs is low, the need is great. Russia?ôs control of the skies has visited a humanitarian catastrophe on Ukraine. Maternity hospitals are in rubble and bodies litter the streets. Last week, Mayor Vadym Boichenko of Mariupol described the siege of his city as ?úArmageddon??and ?útwo days of hell,??with Russian planes flying over residential neighborhoods every 30 minutes, ?úkilling civilians: old people, women, children.??, 'The best answer would be a NATO-imposed no-fly zone. But here, the West is right to be leery ??direct combat between NATO and Russian pilots would be dangerous.', 'But absent that kind of cover, the United States and its allies are obligated to give Ukraine a chance to contest its own skies.', 'The Biden administration has argued that supplying Ukraine with more fighter jets wouldn?ôt have much effect; the country is flying a limited number of sorties with the planes it already has, officials say, and other kinds of weaponry are more important to the overall war effort.', 'But that rings hollow given that the White House supported the transfer of the MIGs just days ago ??and that the Ukrainian president, who presumably knows his country?ôs defense needs best, is pleading for jet fighters again and again.', 'Besides, this shouldn?ôt be a matter of providing one class of weapon or another. NATO nations are perfectly capable of delivering both the jets and the air defense systems Ukraine is requesting. And they should.', 'One other concern skeptics have raised is over how the planes would get to Ukraine. Poland worries that a direct transfer could invite a military response from Russia. So it has suggested that the United States serve as middleman, hosting the MIGs at an American base in Germany before they?ôre flown to Ukraine. Administration officials don?ôt like the idea of NATO pilots flying the jets into Ukraine and coming under fire from the Russians. But there is a way around this problem: Ukrainian pilots could do the flying.', 'Getting jets to Ukraine is not a risk-free proposition. But it?ôs a low-risk proposition. And the moment demands action.', '?úTo be the leader of the world,??Zelensky said, toward the end of his speech, ?úis to be the leader of peace.??, 'On the whole, America has done a fine job of rallying the West to Ukraine?ôs defense.

18,3/16/2022,Russia?ôs last-minute attempt to scuttle Iran nuclear deal must fail,"['Sometimes you can identify a colossal blunder by what doesn?ôt subsequently happen. That?ôs the case with this country?ôs 2018 decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on that nation.', 'Then-President Trump, egged on by Benjamin Netanyahu, the demagogic right-winger who was prime minister of Israel at the time, aborted one of Barack Obama?ôs signature foreign-policy achievements, supposedly in pursuit of a longer-range, more comprehensive deal. He did so despite repeated certification by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran was abiding by the pact, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).', 'Shrugging off the counsel and cajoling of the other signatories to the deal, Trump withdrew this country from the agreement and reverted to sanctions in the hopes of forcing Iran to accede to an arrangement that would not only have far longer timelines than the 2015 agreement but would also constrain Iran?ôs missile program and end its support for other bad actors in the region.', 'Critics of the Trump approach countered that the United States hadn?ôt lost any of its long-term options vis-a-vis Iran by entering the deal; that it simply wasn?ôt realistic to expect a single agreement to cover the broad array of Iran?ôs regional activities; that as a longer-term safeguard, the belt-and-suspenders approach of the existing pact included 25 years of inspections rights over the entirety of Iran?ôs nuclear-fuel cycle; and that the best way to extend the deal?ôs other restrictions on Iran?ôs nuclear activities was to stay in the agreement and negotiate those extensions as time progressed. The hope, of course, was that with economic sanctions lifted, Iran would become more engaged with the Western nations and evolve toward more amenable conduct.', 'So, after Trump ended the deal and reimposed sanctions, what happened? The renewed sanctions did not bring Iran to its knees or cause it to accept a tougher deal. Instead, after a period of continuing to honor the arrangement, Iran, too, abandoned the 2015 agreement. Tensions between the United States and Iran got worse. Whereas the seven-nation compact had limited uranium enrichment to under 4 percent, Iran is now enriching at nearly 60 percent, much closer to the weapons-level concentration of about 90 percent. Amid cloak-and-dagger explosions at its Natanz underground facility, Iran has also brought new lines of advanced enrichment centrifuges into use.', 'Iran now has 12 times the amount of enriched uranium it possessed when the nuclear deal was in effect, amounting to about 70 percent of the close-to-weapons-grade uranium required for one atomic bomb. Whereas, under the deal, Iran was judged to be at least a year from breakout ??the period in which it would have enough enriched uranium for a bomb ??experts say it is now only three to six weeks away. (The ?úbreakout??terminology can sound overly alarmist, in that it seems to suggest Iran could have a functioning and deliverable bomb in that period, and not just enough fissile material for one.)', 'Until quite recently, it appeared that the Biden administration?ôs efforts to reestablish the 2015 nuclear deal were on the cusp of success and that the remaining problems were mostly about finding face-saving cover for each side. However, Russia?ôs war against Ukraine has complicated things. Russia, part of the original eight-party agreement ??the others are Iran, China, France, Britain, the United States, Germany, and the European Union ??is insisting that any future business or military dealing it has with Iran be free of US and EU sanctions imposed because of its invasion of Ukraine. Although a new agreement could theoretically be struck without Moscow, Russia had previously taken Iran?ôs excess uranium stockpiles, so another nation would have to assume that role.', 'A second complication is the recent Iranian missile strike near a US diplomatic facility in Erbil, in northern Iraq, for which the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran?ôs large, quasi-institutionalized rogue military organization, has claimed responsibility. The group said its strike, which caused no deaths, had targeted an Israeli spy center in retaliation for a recent strike by Israel on a weapons-and-ammunition depot in Syria that the Revolutionary Guard claims killed several of its members.', 'This missile jousting is the kind of thing conservatives insist any deal with Iran must constrain. In fact, however, in a region rife with tensions and tit-for-tat retaliation from diverse well-armed militia, it underscores the critical need to keep the Iranian government from developing nuclear weapons that might then find their way into the possession of shadowy, chaos-inclined groups.', 'Further, the entire experience with the nuclear deal demonstrates that it?ôs far easier to upend a carefully negotiated multinational agreement than to negotiate or restore such an arrangement. That?ôs a lesson everyone should bear in mind if the Biden team does find a way to reestablish the former compact. Although such a renewed agreement probably won?ôt have extended timelines, it would put the United States back in a position where a longer-term modus vivendi with Iran could be productively pursued.', 'That?ôs not a guarantee, noted Jeffrey Lewis, a professor and expert in nuclear nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, but rather a theory of the case that runs this way: ?úIf you get to the point where the deal is reinstated and we are confident they don?ôt want to build a bomb, and they are getting sanctions relief, then why would anybody want to kill the golden goose???, 'Conservatives, predictably, will. On Monday, in a resurgence of Republican world-as-triumphalist-will-and-idea posturing, 49 of the Senate?ôs 50 GOP members vowed to do everything they can to block any deal that does not meet their comprehensive demands. When evaluating those declarations, Americans should recall what happened when Trump and his team made the extremely unlikely perfect the enemy of the already-established good. Not only was no progress made, but Iran moved closer to a possible bomb, making the Middle East a more dangerous place.']","['Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Jeffrey Lewis', 'Biden', 'Trump']",The Boston Globe

And Mr. Zelensky certainly had a point: Through resolutions that have the character of international law, the Security Council is supposed to be able to deter and punish clear-cut violations of the U.N. charter, such as the invasion of Ukraine that began Feb. 24. This has proved impossible, however, since the invader ??Russia ??is one of five nations empowered with a Security Council veto. Catch-22.', 'Does this evident failure support Mr. Zelensky?ôs broader indictment of the U.N. system? Yes and no. Plainly, obstruction by Russian President Vladimir Putin?ôs representatives on the Security Council has prevented globally enforceable economic sanctions against Moscow, like those imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and on Iran for unlawful nuclear weapons development in 2006.

Other features of the U.N. system nevertheless retain some usefulness, as the current crisis has shown. The first is the charter itself, which, even if not strictly enforced due to the Russian veto, provided Ukraine with an irrefutable legal standard of aggression around which to rally domestic and international support. That norm became the basis of a General Assembly resolution, supported by 141 nations, deploring the Russian attack, defining it, albeit nonbindingly, as illegal aggression, and demanding its cessation. The United Nations has an internationally selected permanent staff, whose titular head ??Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres ??has added his voice and prestige to condemnations of Russia?ôs conduct.', 'The United Nations, in short, provided a forum, of acknowledged international legitimacy, through which the foes of Moscow?ôs aggression could apply political pressure to it and, indeed, to all nations, which had to state their positions for the record, contemporary and historical. Crucially, this was a forum that the Russians could influence but not control, as they do their own state-dominated legislatures and media. The truth can at least be stated in Turtle Bay, as Mr. Zelensky himself did.', 'Obviously, the United Nations did not, by itself, keep the peace in Ukraine, any more than it did in dozens of other cases over the past 77 years. It needs reform, and the U.S.-backed proposal to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, which passed the General Assembly on Thursday, was a step in that direction.

In many parts of the developing world, there will be a genuine risk of starvation and famine, because low-income countries do not have enough money to pay high food prices. Fifty countries depend on Russia and Ukraine for more than 30 percent of their wheat, and many are among the poorest nations in North Africa, Asia and the Middle East.', 'The worst possible response to the food crisis would be for wealthy nations to halt or heavily restrict exports of key crops. It?ôs tempting in tough times to hold on to all available supplies, but that exacerbates hunger in developing nations. This scenario played out during the Great Recession in 2008, when dozens of countries severely curbed exports of key crops, triggering food riots from Egypt to Haiti.

The first was Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has so impressively rallied his people and galvanized the world against Russian aggression. The clarity he provided in a live address delivered remotely from Kyiv to a congressional assembly in Washington was moral and emotional, conveyed not only in his own words but also in a graphic video compilation of Russian atrocities against Ukraine?ôs civilian population.', '', 'Evoking aerial attacks in U.S. history such as Pearl Harbor and Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Zelensky reminded lawmakers that his country ?úexperienced the same ??every night for three weeks now.??He repeated his request, to which the United States had already responded coolly, for a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine. But then, showing that pragmatism is also one of his leadership talents, Mr. Zelensky proposed the ?úalternative??of supplying Ukraine with aircraft and antiaircraft systems.', 'To this wise suggestion, the second president to speak ??President Biden ??replied by announcing that the United States will indeed step up its military shipments to Ukraine, to include more shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles and ?úlonger-range systems,??seemingly a reference to the Russian-made S-300 batteries that Mr. Zelensky specifically asked for, and that might be available from Eastern European NATO members. Mr. Biden also offered ?úcutting edge??drones. All told, the president said, the United States has authorized $1 billion in military aid in just the past week. This is, indeed, a credible alternative to the no-fly zone, the risks of which still outweigh the benefits, and which NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg separately ruled out in a statement between the end of Mr. Zelensky?ôs remarks and the beginning of Mr. Biden?ôs.', 'Some Republicans continue to blame Vladimir Putin?ôs war on Mr. Biden?ôs purported ?úenormous mistakes????as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) put it ??or to fault the U.S. president for not doing enough to help Ukraine?ôs cause, now that it is suddenly politically popular in this country. Indeed, that cause might even be more popular among Republican voters than Mr. Putin?ôs most famous American apologist, former president Donald Trump. Such election-year foreign policy partisanship should end. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden?ôs best answer to it is to stay the course he?ôs on, which includes trying to build on the good-faith support his policy has received from responsible leaders in both parties. That will also, inevitably, include widening of economic sanctions on Russia.', 'Mr. Biden?ôs tone was that of a leader who understands that Ukraine?ôs war is necessary, just ??and likely to go on. Confirmation and clarity on all of those points were provided, albeit backhandedly, by Mr. Putin, who delivered a speech of his own Wednesday. The Russian leader, in contrast to his diplomats??recent words about a negotiated ?úcompromise,??indicated that he has no intention of ending his war soon. He doubled down on his false justification ??that Ukraine is a neo-Nazi state that was threatening Russian security, possibly with weapons of mass destruction. ?ùThey think that we will break down, retreat,"" Mr. Putin said. ?úBut they do not know our history and our people well.??, 'Also Wednesday, Russia attacked and partially destroyed a theater building in the besieged city of Mariupol in which hundreds of women and children had taken refuge, demonstrating anew the lengths ??and depths ??to which Mr. Putin may yet take his monstrous war.']","['Zelensky', 'Jens Stoltenberg', 'Putin', 'Ted Cruz', 'Vladimir Putin?ôs', 'Donald Trump', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Biden']",The Washington Post
29,3/7/2022,"As Russia escalates its aggression on Ukraine, evidence of war crimes mounts","['Among the many ways Russian President Vladimir Putin?ôs invasion of Ukraine threatens human progress is the degree to which it defies the laws of war. Those laws emerged from the crucible of the 20th century to reflect a noble, if never fully realized, goal: curbing the worst excesses of armed conflict. As Mr. Putin?ôs forces bombard Ukrainian cities, the question of war crimes necessarily ??appropriately ??presents itself. What a prosecutor might call probable cause to suspect Russia of war crimes already exists, relating both to its reasons for launching the conflict and the manner in which it has waged it.', 'Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debatesArrowRight', 'First, Mr. Putin?ôs rationale for war utterly lacks the necessary legal basis ??or jus ad bellum, in legal Latin. Recognized at the post-World War II Nuremberg trials of accused Nazi war criminals, the crime of aggression was defined in a 1998 treaty establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC): ?úThe planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.??That perfectly fits Mr. Putin?ôs assault on United Nations member Ukraine?ôs sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.', 'Next comes the issue of jus in bello  ??the lawfulness of the Russian military?ôs actual conduct on the battlefield. The basic rule is that there may be no deliberate targeting of civilians, and that collateral damage is legally tolerable only if it results from attacks that were themselves intended to hit military targets, with proportionate force. Obviously, those criteria leave a lot of room for debate ??but not about the massive Russian shelling of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and other densely populated cities, which has struck schools, apartment buildings and hospitals. Hospitals are supposed to enjoy special protection because of international law?ôs requirement that medical care is provided impartially even amid war. Yet the World Health Organization says nine attacks have hit health facilities, health-care workers and ambulances since Feb. 24. Fleeing civilians are entitled to safe passage, yet one of the ugliest incidents of the war so far was Sunday?ôs sudden mortar attack on a civilian area of Irpin, outside of Kyiv, which killed four people, including an 8-year-old. Even when no one is killed or injured, artillery barrages such as those being unleashed by Russia can violate the laws of war, which expressly prohibit the ?úwanton destruction??of property.', 'The ICC?ôs chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has announced that the court will investigate potential war crimes stemming from the Russian invasion. This may or may not lead to prosecutions such as those which imposed accountability for atrocities in ex-Yugoslavia during the early 1990s. Russia has never recognized the ICC?ôs jurisdiction ??and neither has Ukraine. (Or the United States.) Unlikely as it may be that Mr. Putin himself ever stands trial, Russian officers assigned with following his orders may be deterred by the prospect that they will be. Lives may yet be saved if those waging this war fully understand that it is a crime in every sense of the word, moral and legal.']","['Putin', 'Vladimir Putin']",The Washington Post

The toll of killed and wounded is rising; fleeing civilians are clogging highways. This time, the victim is Ukraine, a member state of the United Nations inhabited by more than 43 million people. The perpetrator is Russia, whose repressive ruler, President Vladimir Putin, insists ??contrary to black-letter international law ??that Ukraine has no sovereign rights he is bound to respect. Once again, civilized life in this strategically vital continent is being overwhelmed by blood and fire. The conflict may be contained ??for the moment ??in Europe?ôs eastern reaches. But Russia?ôs war could all too easily spread, with destabilizing repercussions worldwide. And once again, the United States is called upon to respond.', 'What you need to know about the Russia-Ukraine crisis', 'The United States has no mutual defense treaty with Ukraine and, thus, no legal or prudential obligation to protect it militarily. Many Americans may wish, instinctively and understandably, not to get involved in a European war, even indirectly, by levying sanctions on the aggressor, Russia. Such measures could trigger disruptions in energy and financial markets, creating costs for people in the United States, when we already suffer from problems ranging from a pandemic to inflation to racial injustice. Certainly, this country, its service members ??and their families ??paid a high price, financial and human, in, and for, Middle Eastern wars that ended without clear victory. President Biden must keep his promise to limit the pain to his own people.', 'Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debatesArrowRight', 'And yet, as an encouragingly bipartisan range of members of Congress advocated Thursday, Mr. Biden can and must counter Mr. Putin robustly, even at some risk to the United States and allied nations, which are also isolating Russia economically and diplomatically.

Raising the costs to Mr. Putin of this adventure may still have an impact, but not unless those costs are truly punishing to Russia?ôs economy and to the business oligarchs who dominate it in corrupt collaboration with the Russian president. The immediate and long-term impact of the sanctions Mr. Biden added Thursday could be substantial; the mere threat of them caused Russia?ôs currency, the ruble, to plunge in value. Russia?ôs crucial revenue source, the oil and gas industry, retained access to the Brussels-based SWIFT interbank payment facilitation system. Key European allies, without whom there could be no SWIFT ban, objected to expelling Russia from the system, a move that would have potential blowback against  Western economies themselves. Mr. Biden says the bank asset freezes will offset this omission, and there is a plausible case that he?ôs right.
