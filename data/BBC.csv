0,Bucha killings: 'I wish they had killed me too' - BBC News,"VolodymyrAbramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire.Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter.But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said.  ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed.The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet.  Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control.The Russian soldiers who killed OlegAbramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate.  ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke.""Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said.Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road.  ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, VolodymyrZelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg.  ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.""Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far.  There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said.  ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""Inside Thatcher and Reagan's close political relationshipWhat did Putin do before he came to power?On the hunt for a serial killer"
1,Donbas: Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east - BBC News,"Russia has pulled troops away from Kyiv and shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after a series of defeats near the capital. This push into the area known as Donbas could mean a protracted conflict.,What would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim his goal of ""liberating"" Ukraine's old industrial heart and is that possible? ,Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east, reducing Mariupol to ruins, but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine's military. ,Preparing for a reinvigorated Russian onslaught on the east, President VolodymyrZelensky vowed: ""We will fight for every metre of our land."",Ukraine's best-trained forces were already posted in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses, but are still a significant challenge to Russia's invading army.,When President Putin talks of Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. What he really means is the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border.,Nato also expects Russian forces to try to create a land bridge, running along the south coast west of Donetsk to Crimea.,""The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine,"" says SamCranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. ,These areas may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. ""Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension,"" says defence specialist KonradMuzyka, head of Rochan Consulting.,None,The Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. ,When the war began, two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by separatists, who created Russian-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. ,Just before the war, President Putin recognised the entirety of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. ,If Russia were to conquer both big regions, it would give VladimirPutin some sort of achievement from Russia's war. The next step would then be to annexe Donbas, just like he did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014. ,And if it came before 9 May, he would even be able to display on Victory Day, when Russia's military still celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.,The Russian puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of having a referendum in the ""near future"", although the idea of even a sham vote in a war zone seems absurd.,Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraine's army in the east, moving in from the north, east and south. ""This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this,"" says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London.,After weeks of fighting, they failed to capture Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv south of the Russian border, but eventually seized control of Izyum - a strategic town further down the main motorway heading into the separatist-controlled east. ,Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. ""Save yourself and your family while you still can,"" local leader SerhiyHaidai appealed to residents as buses and trains headed west. Getting buses through to evacuate Rubizhne and Popasna was becoming increasingly difficult, he said.,The towns now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since Russian-backed separatists first seized large parts of Donbas.,The next big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. ,The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says if Ukraine holds on to Slovyansk, Russia's campaign to seize both regions ""will likely fail"".,Russian forces are bombarding a succession of towns further to the east in areas of Luhansk still under Ukrainian control, including Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna and Severodonetsk. Blocks of flats have been destroyed and civilians killed in their homes. ,These towns are important because controlling them would enable Russia to drive west and link up with Russian forces planning to move south-east of Izyum, says the ISW.,Not only are the Russians trying to control the supply lines by road, they are also trying to block Ukrainian access to rail routes from the west. Rail is the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry and it is the fastest route out for fleeing civilians.,Controlling parts of the rail network would also enable Russian forces to move their troops and supplies.,Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. ""Save yourself and your family while you still can,"" local leader Serhiy Haidai appealed to residents as buses and trains headed west. Getting buses through to evacuate Rubizhne and Popasna was becoming increasingly difficult, he said.,Trains were still running from Slovyansk on Thursday, but lines have been cut to Izyum in the north and to Mariupol and Melitopol in the south. ,MarynaAgafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk, leaving her parents behind as Russian shells continued to fall. ""They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity."",Ukrainian forces were still holding out there in numbers, she told the BBC: ""They aren't letting the Russians occupy it."",Life under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter, although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February.,One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution.,""I'm scared - it's just scary,"" she said. Men of military age were required to join the local militia, so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding, she explained.,""They're mobilising [men] on the streets, catching them. There are no men in the shops, in town, on the streets."" As a result, all male-dominated businesses are shut, she said.,""We're already Russia, although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport."",At the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. ,""We don't really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now,"" said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi, who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks.,Russian forces have already sustained high losses after more than five weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. They are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas as well as the broader Russian army.,('""The main goal for the Ukrainians is to inflict as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles,"" says KonradMuzyka.',),One man called Mykyta who managed to flee the Russian bombardment of Mariupol said he was confident the Ukrainian army would succeed in fighting back.,""Some day they will return our cities, the Azov battalion will not surrender Mariupol,"" he told the BBC.

2,Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion - BBC News,"Russia has withdraw troops from the north of Ukraine as it shifts its focus to capturing more territory in the eastern regions of the country.Here are the latest developments on day 43 of the invasion: Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but its forces have now ""abandoned the attack on Kyiv"" and withdrawn from around the capital, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Analysts at the ISW believe the Russian units which have withdrawn into Belarus from around Kyiv are unlikely to ""regain combat effectiveness for some time"" and it is unclear if they will be redeployed.Ukrainian forces have retaken areas around Kyiv and to the north of the city in recent days after Russian forces abandoned their assault on the capital and withdrew across the border into Belarus and western Russia. Images from several of the liberated towns to the west of Kyiv show huge amounts of damage and destruction to lives and property, with allegations of war crimes having been committed by Russian troops. The mayor of Sumy, near the north-eastern border, confirmed on Wednesday that Russian troops had left the city.The Russian withdrawal has also allowed Ukrainian forces to retake the area around Chernihiv, a strategically important city to the north-east of Kyiv that sits between the capital and the Russian border.Ukrainian forces are now pushing north of Chernihiv to re-establish control of the border itself, according to the ISW. With recent setbacks elsewhere in the country, Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas.The Donbas broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before Russia's invasion. Russian troops in the region are said to have made minor gains in recent days, with the focus primarily on air and artillery attacks around Rubizhne. While the bombardment of Kharkiv in the north of Luhansk continues, analysts at the ISW say Russian troops are hoping to advance down from Izyum towards Slovyansk and encircle Ukrainian forces to the east. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who is in the Donbas, saw a tailback of traffic stretching 80km (50 miles) on Wednesday as thousands of people try to flee the fighting. Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. Ukrainian forces remain in control of the city centre despite the steady Russian advance, but analysts say it is unclear how much longer the Ukrainians can hold on.The UK Ministry of Defence says Russian forces are preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the city, where more than 100,000 people are thought to remain trapped. To the west, Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa, with the aim of cutting off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. Their advances stalled at Mykolaiv, where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson.But Russia continues to launch air strikes against Odesa, with oil facilities in the city targeted in an attack earlier this week.By David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk, Debie Loizou and Prina Shah.NoneFrom 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between ""Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory"" and ""Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine"", the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control.
