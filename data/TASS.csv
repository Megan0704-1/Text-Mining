As noted on the website of the upper chamber of Congress, the document, initiated on January 19 by a group of senators led by Republican John Cornyn, was passed unanimously. To become a law, the draft must still be approved by members of the House of Representatives and signed by President JoeBiden."
1,Lukashenko says Putin promises he would regard attack on Belarus as attack on Russia -  Russian Politics &amp; Diplomacy - TASS,"Belarusian President AlexanderLukashenko says he has received assurances from Russian President VladimirPutin the Russian leadership would regard an attack against Belarus as an attack against Russia. A Telegram channel close to the Belarusian presidential press service released a video with Lukashenko?™s statement to this effect on Thursday.""We have a joint group. Part of it is on the western border of Russia. I asked him (the Russian president - TASS) to avoid using part of that group. To keep it in reserve just in case, if something happens. His reply was: ?˜I promise you that any attack against or just one step across the border into the Belarusian territory would mean that they attack Russia??"" Lukashenko cited Putin as saying.""I would like them (in the West - TASS) to hear and understand this. And refrain from lying and coining fakes,"" Lukashenko added.Also, he pointed out that NATO was quickly building up forces on the border with Belarus in Poland and in the Baltic countries."
2,Kiev bogus stories raise doubts about its readiness for diplomacy ??Russian ambassador -  Russian Politics &amp; Diplomacy - TASS,"The Ukrainian authorities are stepping up a campaign to spread deliberately false accusations against the Russian military, which raises doubts about the sincerity of Kiev?™s statements about their desire to seek ways to resolve the crisis through diplomacy, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said on Wednesday. He was responding to a question from the American edition of Newsweek.""Every day, the Ukrainian authorities are stepping up their anti-Russian misinformation campaign, throwing in unsubstantiated accusations of alleged atrocities and war crimes of the Russian Armed Forces. Judging by the rhetoric, the leadership of Ukraine is driven not so much by concern for the civilian population as by the desire to secure the image of a ""victim"" and discredit our country,"" he said as quoted on the embassy's Telegram channel.""The reaction of some countries to the tragic events in the city of Bucha is surprising. Without bothering to understand what happened, colleagues blamed the Russian military for everything. Inconsistencies indicating the fabricated nature of the action are ignored. I would like to note that on March 31, the mayor of the city of Bucha [Anatoly] Fedoruk stated the withdrawal of Russian troops and did not say a word about the shot residents. The first accusations appeared in the Western media only on April 3. It seems unlikely that no one noticed the dead bodies lying on the streets for four days,"" the diplomat emphasized.""On April 1, representatives of the Security Service of Ukraine and the national police came in. They announced their intention to clear the territory from Russian accomplices. Ukrainian radicals even called for the execution of ordinary citizens who do not have special identification marks,"" he said.Antonov noted that ""the Russian Defense Ministry also has evidence about the planned terrible crimes of the Ukrainian authorities in the Sumy and Kiev regions.""""We know for certain that the Kiev regime is preparing yet another provocative content about the death of civilians in the Kharkov region, allegedly as a result of the actions of the Russian Armed Forces. People are paid $25 for taking part in staged filming,"" he specified.""All this is happening at the very moment when the Ukrainian side has expressed its readiness to reaffirm its non-nuclear, non-bloc and neutral status. For all countries, this is extremely important. In this context, the sincerity of Kiev's statements about the desire to seek ways to resolve the crisis diplomatically is highly questionable,"" the ambassador said."
