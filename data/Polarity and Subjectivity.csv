As noted on the website of the upper chamber of Congress, the document, initiated on January 19 by a group of senators led by Republican John Cornyn, was passed unanimously.

A Telegram channel close to the Belarusian presidential press service released a video with Lukashenko?™s statement to this effect on Thursday.""We have a joint group. Part of it is on the western border of Russia. I asked him (the Russian president - TASS) to avoid using part of that group. To keep it in reserve just in case, if something happens. His reply was: ?˜I promise you that any attack against or just one step across the border into the Belarusian territory would mean that they attack Russia??"" Lukashenko cited Putin as saying.""I would like them (in the West - TASS) to hear and understand this.

2,"The Ukrainian authorities are stepping up a campaign to spread deliberately false accusations against the Russian military, which raises doubts about the sincerity of Kiev?™s statements about their desire to seek ways to resolve the crisis through diplomacy, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said on Wednesday. He was responding to a question from the American edition of Newsweek.""Every day, the Ukrainian authorities are stepping up their anti-Russian misinformation campaign, throwing in unsubstantiated accusations of alleged atrocities and war crimes of the Russian Armed Forces. Judging by the rhetoric, the leadership of Ukraine is driven not so much by concern for the civilian population as by the desire to secure the image of a ""victim"" and discredit our country,"" he said as quoted on the embassy's Telegram channel.""The reaction of some countries to the tragic events in the city of Bucha is surprising. Without bothering to understand what happened, colleagues blamed the Russian military for everything. Inconsistencies indicating the fabricated nature of the action are ignored. I would like to note that on March 31, the mayor of the city of Bucha [Anatoly] Fedoruk stated the withdrawal of Russian troops and did not say a word about the shot residents. The first accusations appeared in the Western media only on April 3. It seems unlikely that no one noticed the dead bodies lying on the streets for four days,"" the diplomat emphasized.""On April 1, representatives of the Security Service of Ukraine and the national police came in. They announced their intention to clear the territory from Russian accomplices. Ukrainian radicals even called for the execution of ordinary citizens who do not have special identification marks,"" he said.Antonov noted that ""the Russian Defense Ministry also has evidence about the planned terrible crimes of the Ukrainian authorities in the Sumy and Kiev regions.""""We know for certain that the Kiev regime is preparing yet another provocative content about the death of civilians in the Kharkov region, allegedly as a result of the actions of the Russian Armed Forces. People are paid $25 for taking part in staged filming,"" he specified.""All this is happening at the very moment when the Ukrainian side has expressed its readiness to reaffirm its non-nuclear, non-bloc and neutral status. For all countries, this is extremely important. In this context, the sincerity of Kiev's statements about the desire to seek ways to resolve the crisis diplomatically is highly questionable,"" the ambassador said.",TASS,-0.03581632653061226,0.32884353741496597
3,"VolodymyrAbramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire.Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter.But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said.  ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed.The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet.  Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control.The Russian soldiers who killed OlegAbramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate.  ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke.""Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said.Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road.  ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, VolodymyrZelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg.  ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.""Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far.  There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said.  ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""Inside Thatcher and Reagan's close political relationshipWhat did Putin do before he came to power?On the hunt for a serial killer",BBC,-0.014233945483945475,0.37837549087549094
4,"Russia has pulled troops away from Kyiv and shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after a series of defeats near the capital. This push into the area known as Donbas could mean a protracted conflict.,What would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim his goal of ""liberating"" Ukraine's old industrial heart and is that possible? ,Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east, reducing Mariupol to ruins, but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine's military. ,Preparing for a reinvigorated Russian onslaught on the east, President VolodymyrZelensky vowed: ""We will fight for every metre of our land."",Ukraine's best-trained forces were already posted in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists.

The rest was run by separatists, who created Russian-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. ,Just before the war, President Putin recognised the entirety of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. ,If Russia were to conquer both big regions, it would give VladimirPutin some sort of achievement from Russia's war. The next step would then be to annexe Donbas, just like he did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014. ,And if it came before 9 May, he would even be able to display on Victory Day, when Russia's military still celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.,The Russian puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of having a referendum in the ""near future"", although the idea of even a sham vote in a war zone seems absurd.,Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraine's army in the east, moving in from the north, east and south.

Blocks of flats have been destroyed and civilians killed in their homes. ,These towns are important because controlling them would enable Russia to drive west and link up with Russian forces planning to move south-east of Izyum, says the ISW.,Not only are the Russians trying to control the supply lines by road, they are also trying to block Ukrainian access to rail routes from the west.

5,"Russia has withdraw troops from the north of Ukraine as it shifts its focus to capturing more territory in the eastern regions of the country.Here are the latest developments on day 43 of the invasion: Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but its forces have now ""abandoned the attack on Kyiv"" and withdrawn from around the capital, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Analysts at the ISW believe the Russian units which have withdrawn into Belarus from around Kyiv are unlikely to ""regain combat effectiveness for some time"" and it is unclear if they will be redeployed.Ukrainian forces have retaken areas around Kyiv and to the north of the city in recent days after Russian forces abandoned their assault on the capital and withdrew across the border into Belarus and western Russia. Images from several of the liberated towns to the west of Kyiv show huge amounts of damage and destruction to lives and property, with allegations of war crimes having been committed by Russian troops. The mayor of Sumy, near the north-eastern border, confirmed on Wednesday that Russian troops had left the city.The Russian withdrawal has also allowed Ukrainian forces to retake the area around Chernihiv, a strategically important city to the north-east of Kyiv that sits between the capital and the Russian border.Ukrainian forces are now pushing north of Chernihiv to re-establish control of the border itself, according to the ISW. With recent setbacks elsewhere in the country, Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas.The Donbas broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before Russia's invasion. Russian troops in the region are said to have made minor gains in recent days, with the focus primarily on air and artillery attacks around Rubizhne. While the bombardment of Kharkiv in the north of Luhansk continues, analysts at the ISW say Russian troops are hoping to advance down from Izyum towards Slovyansk and encircle Ukrainian forces to the east. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who is in the Donbas, saw a tailback of traffic stretching 80km (50 miles) on Wednesday as thousands of people try to flee the fighting. Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. Ukrainian forces remain in control of the city centre despite the steady Russian advance, but analysts say it is unclear how much longer the Ukrainians can hold on.The UK Ministry of Defence says Russian forces are preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the city, where more than 100,000 people are thought to remain trapped. To the west, Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa, with the aim of cutting off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. Their advances stalled at Mykolaiv, where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson.But Russia continues to launch air strikes against Odesa, with oil facilities in the city targeted in an attack earlier this week.By David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk, Debie Loizou and Prina Shah.NoneFrom 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between ""Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory"" and ""Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine"", the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control.

6,"The United States was expected to announce tough new sanctions on Russia Wednesday, including a ban on new investments, a day after Ukraine's president showed the UN Security Council harrowing images of violence and accused Moscow of widespread atrocities. The sanctions come after an outcry over the discovery of dozens of bodies in civilian clothing in areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn around Ukraine's capital, including the town of Bucha.  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky likened Russia's actions to Nazi atrocities in an impassioned speech by videolink to the 15-member UN Security Council on Tuesday.  ""They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children,"" Zelensky said.  He demanded stronger action from Western powers and called for Russia's exclusion from the Council, where it holds veto power. Later in his nightly address, a frustrated Zelensky said Russia was blocking the UN from carrying out ""the functions for which it was created.""  ""The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn't,"" he said.  In an interview with the BBC, the U.S. ambassador to the UN admitted that ""no one can question [Zelensky's] frustration with the Council and how the Council operates."". But she insisted that the Council was holding Russia to account, and that Moscow was isolated within it.  The killings in Bucha and elsewhere have galvanized support for Ukraine, with Washington announcing another $100 million in military aid, and produced new momentum for additional sanctions on Moscow. ""We had already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, and the information from Bucha appears to show further evidence of war crimes,"" a U.S. source familiar with the planned measures said.  On Wednesday, Washington, in coordination with the G7 and the European Union, is expected to announce measures including a ban on all new investments in Russia.   ""You can expect... that they will target Russian government officials, their family members, Russian-owned financial institutions, also state-owned enterprises,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told a briefing on Tuesday.  A new sanctions package being prepared by Europe, meanwhile, is set to include oil and coal, France's foreign minister said at EU talks in Luxembourg. And Britain said it has so far frozen some $350 billion in assets from President Vladimir Putin's ""war chest."" As part of the push to isolate Moscow, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Slovenia expelled dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of being intelligence operatives on Tuesday, following similar moves in France and Germany — a total of some 180 expulsions in 48 hours. The Kremlin called it a ""short-sighted move"" that would complicate efforts to negotiate an end to the hostilities. Putin also warned of ""reprisals"" for recent European measures targeting Russian gas giant Gazprom — and said Moscow would ""monitor"" its food exports to ""hostile"" nations, raising the specter of shortages and price spikes. The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings, claiming the images emerging from Bucha and other sites are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out. At the Security Council meeting, Moscow's ambassador rejected Zelensky's claims, saying the ""ungrounded accusations... are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses."" But satellite photos taken while Bucha was still under Moscow's control show what appear to be bodies lying in streets where the dead were later found by Ukrainian forces and seen by journalists.  And multiple Bucha residents told AFP they had seen Russian soldiers killing civilians. ""Right in front of my eyes, they fired on a man who was going to get food at the supermarket,"" said 43-year-old Olena, who declined to give her family name. During a grim cleanup, the remains of partially burned bodies in black bags were lifted into a van, with officials telling journalists ""dozens of bodies"" remained in apartments and in nearby woods. Western nations have given short shrift to Russia's denials. ""What we've seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit. It's a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who will visit Kyiv this week, has offered the bloc's assistance in documenting proof of war crimes. Ukrainian authorities have warned that others areas may have suffered even worse fates than Bucha.  Scenes of devastation have met those venturing into areas from which Russian forces have withdrawn.  In the northern city of Chernigiv, which was besieged from the early days of the invasion, a charred children's hospital, full of bullet and shrapnel holes, served as a shelter. In the dank basement, children painted on walls — tiny handprints, a smeared rainbow, a fluttering Ukrainian flag. ""Cluster bombs were flying, we have traces of these bombs,"" said 51-year-old Olena Makoviy. ""The injured were brought to the children's hospital, both adults and children."" City officials estimate around 350 civilians have been killed in Chernigiv, with fellow residents digging mass graves to bury them.  ""It was very scary here from the first days of the war,"" said Makoviy. ""They brought guys, handsome, young, but no longer alive."" None The Russian withdrawal from areas around Kyiv and the north is part of a shift of focus toward Ukraine's southeast, in a bid to create a land bridge between occupied Crimea and Moscow-backed separatist statelets in Donbas. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance expects a Russian push in ""coming weeks"" to try to seize the entire Donbas.  In the village of Krasnopillia there, Ukrainian forces were preparing to counter that push.  ""We know the Russians are reinforcing and are getting ready to attack,"" a senior Ukrainian officer on the ground told AFP. ""We are ready... we've planned some surprises for them along the way."" Civilians have been asked to evacuate west and on Tuesday a line of cars stretching 3 kilometers was waiting to pass a checkpoint, while thousands of other residents boarded trains to leave. And violence has continued elsewhere, with Ukraine's prosecutor general saying Tuesday that bombing around Kyiv had killed 12 people. Peace talks between the sides have so far gone nowhere, though Moscow says it is ""ready"" to continue. Ukraine has proposed an agreement where other countries would guarantee its security in return for Kyiv accepting a neutral and non-nuclear status, not joining NATO and refusing to host foreign military bases. The proposal would also see Russia accept Kyiv's admission to the European Union.",Moscow,-0.031521451943987144,0.3304005853301628
7,"After years spent translating Hollywood films, Russian Mila Grekova was suddenly thrown out of work after Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. Five Hollywood giants — Disney, Warner Bros, Universal, Sony Pictures and Paramount — have all stopped releasing new films there, leaving Russian cinemas bereft of the latest blockbusters. But it has not made Grekova turn against President Vladimir Putin. ""It's the West that I hate today and not Putin,"" the 56-year-old said. ""Bollywood may replace Hollywood in Russia, but it's too late for me to learn Hindi,"" she said, referring to India's refusal to condemn Moscow or join in with sanctions. Russia's film industry has been thrown into turmoil by the fighting in Ukraine just as it was beginning to recover from the pandemic. And like in many sectors hit by sanctions, the film industry is turning away from the West, looking inward to its own movies or east to Asia. Russians are avid cinema-goers with the highest number of admission in Europe, 145.7 million last year, according to the European Audiovisual Observatory.  Many flock to see Hollywood films, which are often dubbed instead of being shown with subtitles.  None Before Hollywood's withdrawal, Russian company Mosfilm-Master was dubbing around 10 foreign films a month, mostly from English. ""Now we have lost two thirds"" of business, the company's director Yevgeny Belin told AFP in its high-tech dubbing studio in Moscow. ""During the pandemic, we had films but no cinemas open. Today, we have our cinemas but no films,"" he said. Russia's National Association of Cinema Owners said last month that cinemas risk losing up to 80% of their revenue. Looking to adapt, Mosfilm-Master is on the hunt for translators from Korean and Mandarin, even though Belin said he ""doubts that Asian films work for Russians"" because of cultural differences.  ""Westerners are closer to us,"" said the 70-year-old, who has spent three decades in dubbing.  Olga Zinyakova, the president of Karo, one of Russia's leading cinema chains, said she is confident the industry can rebuild. ""The situation is extremely difficult but not catastrophic,"" the 37-year-old said. ""Since the arrival of Hollywood in post-Soviet Russia 30 years ago, we have gone through a lot of crises: political, economic and the pandemic,"" she said, surrounded by empty seats in Moscow's Oktyabr cinema, home to Europe's largest screening room with 1,500 places. Since the conflict began on Feb. 24, the number of tickets sold in Karo's 35 cinemas has fallen by 70%, Zinyakova said. The Russian government has promised major financial support and tax breaks to film production and cinemas, as it looks to replace Hollywood films with more homegrown fare. ""Russians will explore themselves more deeply,"" said Zinyakova, pointing to the success of Russian films from the 1990s like the cult movie ""Brat"" (""Brother"") which is screening again in several Moscow cinemas. Zinyakova is also preparing to include more Asian and Latin American films among upcoming releases.  ""And when Hollywood comes back, the Russian market and viewers will no longer be the same,"" she said. Pavel Doreuli, a 44-year-old sound designer who works on around 15 Russian films a year, said it was no surprise that Hollywood has pulled out of Russia.  ""World cinema has been hostage to big politics for years,"" he said, saying major film festivals like Cannes and Berlin were no longer about art, but about promoting ""certain values"". Still, Doreuli said it would be a shame for Russia to be cut off from world cinema, pointing to the exclusion of official Russian delegations from this year's Cannes film festival. ""If they are excluded from international festivals, Russians will give up on arthouse cinema that offers a different vision of the world, which is so precious today,"" he said.",Moscow,0.08728453364816999,0.2971389216843762
8,"Western powers were readying new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday after Ukraine's president called for tougher action and accused Moscow of atrocities during the six-week war. The measures follow an international outcry over hundreds of civilians found dead in areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn around Ukraine's capital, including the town of Bucha.  In a video address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky showed harrowing images of corpses — including of children — that he said were victims of Russian atrocities. ""They cut off limbs... slashed their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children,"" he said, after earlier comparing Russia's assault to the 1937 Nazi bombing of the town of Guernica. The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings, claiming the images emerging from Bucha and other sites are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out. Zelensky called for Russia's exclusion from the UN Security Council, where it is one of five members with veto power, saying it was blocking the UN from carrying out ""the functions for which it was created."" On Wednesday, Pope Francis — who has repeatedly called for peace, while not naming Russia or President Vladimir Putin — also deplored the ""powerlessness of international organizations."" At his weekly audience at the Vatican, the 85-year-old pontiff kissed a flag he said had come from ""that martyred city Bucha,"" condemning ""ever more horrendous cruelties"" in Ukraine. The UN General Assembly announced later it would vote Thursday on suspending Russia from the body's Human Rights Council, after moves by the U.S. and Britain to have it excluded. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 11 million displaced as refugees or within Ukraine since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. Western powers have already pummelled Russia with debilitating economic sanctions, which forced Moscow Wednesday to make foreign debt payments on dollar-denominated bonds in rubles. But the killings in Bucha and elsewhere have galvanized support for Kyiv, with Washington announcing another $100 million in military aid, and produced new momentum for additional sanctions on Moscow. Washington, in coordination with the G7 and the European Union, is expected on Wednesday to announce measures including a ban on all new investments in Russia.   ""You can expect... that they will target Russian government officials, their family members, Russian-owned financial institutions, also state-owned enterprises,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told a briefing on Tuesday.  The EU meanwhile was poised to implement a fifth round of sanctions cutting off Russian coal imports -- and European Council chief Charles Michel said that ""sooner or later,"" it must also impose oil and gas sanctions. Condemning ""war crimes"" in Russia, he said: ""There must be, and there will be, severe consequences for all those responsible."" But addressing the Irish parliament Wednesday, Zelensky condemned the ""indecisiveness"" on the part of EU nations, which are dependent on Russian energy. ""We still need to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine with new sources of funding,"" Zelensky added, calling also for the total exclusion of Russian banks from Western finance. In Britain, which says it has so far frozen some $350 billion in assets from Putin's ""war chest,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said what happened in Bucha ""doesn't look far short of genocide to me."" He said the international community ""will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin's regime."" In other moves to isolate Moscow, a string of EU countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain have expelled more than 200 Russian diplomats and staff between them this week. The Kremlin called the mass expulsions a ""short-sighted move"" that would complicate efforts to negotiate an end to the hostilities. Putin also warned of ""reprisals"" for recent European measures targeting Russian gas giant Gazprom — and said Moscow would ""monitor"" its food exports to ""hostile"" nations, raising the specter of shortages and price spikes. At the Security Council meeting, Moscow's ambassador rejected Zelensky's claims, saying the ""ungrounded accusations... are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses."" But satellite photos taken while Bucha was still under Moscow's control show what appear to be bodies lying in streets where the dead were later found by Ukrainian forces and seen by journalists.  And multiple Bucha residents told AFP they had seen Russian soldiers killing civilians. ""Right in front of my eyes, they fired on a man who was going to get food at the supermarket,"" said 43-year-old Olena, who declined to give her family name. During a grim cleanup, the remains of partially burned bodies in black bags were lifted into a van, with officials telling journalists ""dozens of bodies"" remained in apartments and in nearby woods. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who will visit Kyiv this week, has offered the bloc's assistance in documenting proof of war crimes. Ukrainian authorities have warned that other areas may have suffered even worse fates than Bucha.  Scenes of devastation have met those venturing into areas from which Russian forces have withdrawn.  In the northern city of Chernigiv, which was besieged from the early days of the invasion, a charred children's hospital, full of bullet and shrapnel holes, served as a shelter. In the dank basement, children painted on walls — tiny handprints, a smeared rainbow, a fluttering Ukrainian flag. ""Cluster bombs were flying, we have traces of these bombs,"" said 51-year-old Olena Makoviy. ""The injured were brought to the children's hospital, both adults and children."" City officials estimate around 350 civilians have been killed in Chernigiv, with fellow residents digging mass graves to bury them.  ""It was very scary here from the first days of the war,"" said Makoviy. ""They brought guys, handsome, young, but no longer alive."" The Russian withdrawal from areas around Kyiv and the north is part of a shift of focus towards Ukraine's southeast, in a bid to create a land bridge between occupied Crimea and Moscow-backed separatist statelets in Donbas. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance expects a Russian push in ""coming weeks"" to try to seize the entire Donbas.  ""We know the Russians are reinforcing and are getting ready to attack,"" a senior Ukrainian officer in the village of Krasnopillia told AFP.  ""We are ready... we've planned some surprises for them along the way."" Civilians have been asked to evacuate west and on Tuesday a line of cars stretching three kilometers was waiting to pass a checkpoint, while thousands of other residents boarded trains to leave. Russian strikes on Wednesday killed at least two people and wounded five others near a humanitarian distribution point in the east Donetsk region, the regional governor said. Meanwhile shells and rockets were landing at regular intervals in the industrial city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukrainian forces on the eastern frontline. Peace talks between the sides have so far gone nowhere, though Moscow says it is ""ready"" to continue. Ukraine has proposed an agreement where other countries would guarantee its security in return for Kyiv accepting a neutral and non-nuclear status, not joining NATO and refusing to host foreign military bases. The proposal would also see Russia accept Kyiv joining the European Union.",Moscow,-0.0011391529432766547,0.2891493386338747
9,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians ""just for their pleasure"" in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself. Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia's retreat from the town in horrifying detail, describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia's actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC. The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council."" None Zelensky added: ""It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter.  What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?"" he asked.  At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had ""more than doubled"" since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17. In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18. In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was ""not a single crime"" that the Russians ""would not commit,"" alleging that Russian troops had ""searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country."" ""They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone ... They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelensky said.  ""I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,"" he told the UNSC.  ""Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,"" he continued. ""Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them."" Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given ""criminal orders"" and ""carried out them by killing our people"" to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial.  UN: Civilians were targeted Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed ""all the signs"" that civilians were ""directly targeted and directly killed.""   In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were ""very disturbing developments.""   She specifically referenced the ""disturbing"" images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals.   ""We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It's hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,"" Throssell continued.  As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn't have ""exact information"" to share regarding the situation on the ground.  Throssell also paid tribute to the ""crucial role"" that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the ""multiple teams"" involved in ""reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage.""  Russia's response Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky's remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military ""ungrounded.""   ""We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,"" Nebenzia said in translated remarks. The ambassador recalled Zelensky's election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine ""failed to materialize."" None Nebenzia also repeated past claims that ""a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military"" continue to proliferate. Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia ""came to ... Ukraine"" to bring peace, not to ""conquer lands."" Nebenzia's words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only ""groundless, but ... a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.""",CNN,-0.09076074332171892,0.34775358110723964
10,"Oksana Kostychenko walks down a narrow pathway, leading to her back garden in Borodianka. The flower beds on one side are surprisingly well arranged, contrasting with the wanton destruction all around.  Near her garden shed is the body of a man, lying face-down with a bag over his head and hands tied behind his back. His trousers are pulled down. There are large bruises on his left leg and a large wound on his head. Next to his body is a single bullet casing.  ""He was executed, gunshot to the head,"" an officer with the Ukrainian National Police said. There are no documents on the man, but authorities on site say all indications show he was another civilian casualty of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war.  The body is one of many recently found in cities to the east of Kyiv that were occupied by Russian forces. Borodianka was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia's invasion. What was left of the town, after intense shelling and devastating airstrikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, which moved in on February 28. Yuriy Pomin was still in town when the Russian attack started. ""The scariest part was when their planes came. They were flying above our house and dropping bombs,"" Pomin told CNN.  Today, the 33-year-old is cleaning up his fourth-floor apartment. The multi-story building next to his was razed to the ground by a Russian strike, and he's moving what's left of his possessions to another house outside the city. ""I cannot stay here,"" he said. ""It's not safe."" The month-long Russian occupation has left a devastating mark on the city. Not only was it almost entirely destroyed by long-range attacks -- with buildings reduced to mere piles of rubble -- but occupying Russian forces then used some of the houses as their own personnel barracks.  Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr fled when the shelling first began, only to return after the town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1. While their home was seemingly untouched by the heavy shelling that destroyed Borodianka, it was ransacked inside. Clothes and discarded bottles littered the floor. They found their pet bird dead in its cage.  ""Alcohol is everywhere; empty bottles in the hallway, under things,"" the 44-year-old said. ""They (the Russians) smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table. They used the bed linen as their own."" Most of the furniture was either damaged or destroyed, as was their TV.  ""They did everything they wanted,"" Kostychenko said. ""Our jewels were taken away. They're nothing but looters."" Nearby shops have also been pillaged, their windows broken and contents either stolen or splattered over the floors.  The letter ""V,"" short for Vostok (meaning 'east' in Russian) -- and a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military district in concert with the letter ""Z,"" an emblem for Moscow's so-called ""special military operation"" -- was painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints.  The local unemployment office and City Hall were fortified and turned into headquarters for Russian troops stationed in the town. Both were also covered in Vs.  Borodianka was a jumping-off point for Russian units as they advanced on Kyiv through suburbs like Bucha and Irpin. They faced staunch resistance by Ukrainian forces and were forced to retreat. Remains of destroyed Russian hardware in the dozens now litters cities and towns around the capital, and fox holes and artillery positions were left almost untouched. Authorities have imposed a curfew in the entire Kyiv region until April 7, calling on residents to remain indoors while they conduct de-mining operations. Moscow has denied targeting civilians, but volunteers are working with police to pick up the bodies of killed civilians left to rot in the open air.   ""We are gathering people who were shot by the Russians. Civilians who were tortured. We have been working for two days,"" Hennadiy Avramenko, 45, said. CNN watched as Avramenko and his colleague extracted the body of a 44-year-old Ukrainian from a car. He was shot through the heart while driving, with his car crashing into a ditch next to the road. ""Psychologically, it's difficult,"" Avramenko said. ""The worst thing is that we're not finding soldiers, just innocent people. ""They were shot for no reason,"" he added. The volunteers pick up an additional two bodies in the space of an hour. One of them was the charred corpse of a person hit by an artillery round, the other an elderly man who was shot while riding his bicycle.  ""(Monday) we picked up seven people and (by midday Tuesday) we're already at six,"" Avramenko said.   In and around Borodianka, authorities are only now starting to comb through what's left of most buildings, knowing they'll continue to find dead bodies as they do.  Despite the withdrawal of Putin's army from their city, residents of Borodianka fear the destruction it sowed will linger for months, if not years. ",CNN,-0.016737334203087633,0.3394379212872364
11,"The Russian column of tanks and armored personnel carriers sped along a residential street in Bucha, a tree-lined suburb of the capital Kyiv. That was February 27th.  A short time later, that same line of vehicles lay in ruins, the wreckage smoldering, after being ambushed by Ukrainian forces.   There was no sign of the column's soldiers. In a video showing the destruction, a man could be heard muttering: ""I wish you all to burn in hell.""  But that Ukrainian victory was to be short-lived; a month-long occupation of Bucha by Russian forces followed.  The suburb's name has this week become a byword for war crimes, after accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat, as the Kremlin shifts its focus away from the Ukrainian capital to the country's east.  In recent days, Moscow has claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged -- calling it ""fake,"" and part of a ""planned media campaign."" But witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago.  And the devastation there bears similarities to Russia's playbook in other towns and cities in Ukraine, where officials say civilian infrastructure has come under attack -- with power supplies knocked out, water cut off and communications towers damaged -- making it harder for local residents to hold out against Russian troops. But Ukraine has not surrendered. There have also been reports of looting, disappearances, and evidence of the indiscriminate killings of civilians since the war began.  None Horrors on the road Bucha -- once a magnet for young families due to its affordable homes, green spaces, and good schools -- and other areas nearby, turned into a living nightmare in March as Russian troops stormed the region.  Residents there share difficult to verify stories of looted homes, senseless murders and failed escapes via Kyiv's Zhytomyr highway -- now a graveyard for wrecked tanks and burned-out cars.   In Bucha, pitch-roofed homes crumbled under the force of Russian artillery strikes.  Residents say they had no choice but to turn their vegetable patches and front yards into makeshift graves, since the presence of Russian forces made it impossible to reach the morgue or local cemetery. Anna Bilous, 48, had lived in Bucha for eight years before the Russian troops arrived. She sheltered in her home with her husband and two sons, but around March 4, when the electricity cut out and the pipes ran dry, it became clear they had to leave, she told CNN.  They decided that Bilous and her two sons would flee on foot, heading for the nearby suburb of Irpin on March 9, while her husband stayed behind to care for the family's elderly neighbors.  The trio traveled on side roads to avoid the Russian soldiers, but when they turned onto Yablunska Street, the family was stunned to find dead bodies scattered across the road -- including one lifeless man collapsed under a bicycle.     Bilous believes the man's body remained there for close to a month, until he and some 20 other civilians were photographed for the world to see this past weekend.  Bucha's mayor has described their deaths as an execution.  Bilous' account and satellite images captured on March 18, shared by Maxar Technologies, show that the bodies had lain in the street for weeks, since the town was under Russian control -- Russia held Bucha until March 31.  On Tuesday, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov continued to deny the accusations of brutal civilian killings in Bucha, saying the claims are not only ""groundless, but are a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army."" Reports of executions About a mile away, at a sanatorium in Vokzal'na Street on Monday, Ukrainian officials ushered journalists into a cold basement where the contorted and bloodied bodies of five men lay in an advanced state of decay.  Some of those in this dimly-lit space had been kneecapped. Others, their arms bound behind their backs, had been shot multiple times. Bullet casings littered the ground.  Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, said it was a cruel display of torture and execution by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify his claim.  The men were killed sometime in the last three weeks, officials say. Their bodies are as yet unidentified, since no personal documents have been found.  In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied anyone was harmed.   ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" Officials say Russian forces bedded down in the sanatorium around the second week of March. Several foxholes, trenches, and positions for armored vehicles remain visible around the site; leftover Russian rations have been abandoned nearby.  Soldiers have daubed the exterior walls of the facility with the letter ""V,"" a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military District, and used synonymously with the letter ""Z,"" as an emblem for Russia's ""special military operation.""         The gruesome scene proved too much for Vladislav Minchenko, who vomited after volunteering to help remove the bodies from the basement on Monday. ""This is not what we learned in school,"" said Minchenko, 44, who worked as a painter before the war. Holding up his hands, Minchenko told CNN the number of dead bodies he had dealt with since the start of the conflict numbered in the ""hundreds -- not dozens -- hundreds."" Hasty burials in mass grave  Shelling, live fire, and trigger-happy Russian soldiers made it too dangerous for those injured in the assault on Bucha to seek treatment at the local hospital in the center of town, according to residents.  The local morgue in Bucha ran out of space as deaths mounted in March; to deal with all the bodies, a tractor was brought in to dig a mass grave in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, its abbot, Andriy Galavin told CNN. ""There were too many dead people, and there was no way to properly bury them because getting to the cemetery was simply unrealistic because of the shelling,"" Galavin said.   There was also a lack of resources, such as coffins, due to the main bridge connecting Bucha to Irpin being blown up at the start of the war, Galavin said.     As of this weekend, Kyiv Regional Police and residents believed the remains of at least 150 people had been laid to rest in the grave, but the mayor of Bucha said the death toll could be as high as 300. CNN could not independently verify those claims. Galavin returned to Bucha last week once the town was liberated; he said the plan was to exhume the bodies, identify them via DNA analysis and hopefully provide some solace to relatives still searching for missing loved ones.  None Tip of the iceberg The devastation wrought in Bucha is just the tip of the iceberg, Ukrainian President Zelensky warned on Monday.  ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago,"" President Zelensky said. ""The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this.""  One grisly example of the callous indifference for human life was found in Motyzhyn, a village around 20 miles south of Bucha. The local mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was discovered half-buried in a ditch alongside members of her family. Ukrainian officials said Saturday that she was killed after being captured by Russian forces. And, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says that 11 local mayors are being held by the Russians, which CNN cannot verify.  ""Unfortunately, so far, we have not been able to get in touch or to free any other city mayors and we don't even know, we think that some of them were killed,"" she told CNN, promising that the perpetrators would pay for their crimes against Ukraine. ""We will find them and kill them, and we will punish everyone who killed our city mayors, our journalists, our priests, our activists."" As Ukrainian officials race to clear mines and booby traps left by retreating Russian troops, they fear civilian casualties may be much higher in Borodyanka, 14 miles west of Bucha. Oksana Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr returned home to Borodyanka over the weekend after fleeing the area on February 27. They discovered that their house had been trashed and looted by Russian soldiers. The couple also found a dead man in their backyard. His arms were tied behind his back, and his trousers had been pulled down.  ""Alcohol is everywhere. Empty bottles in the hallway, under things,"" Oksana said. ""They smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table... They lived here as they wished."" Anna Bilous and her sons made it out of Bucha on March 10. But the fate of the dead man they saw lying beneath a bicycle as they fled still haunts her.  ""I feel like me and my sons could be in the same place as the man who died,"" she said. ""I feel the pain and sadness of all these lost people."" ",CNN,-0.07557195633584524,0.323125367430923
