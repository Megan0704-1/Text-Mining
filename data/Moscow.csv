U.S. to Announce New Sanctions on Russia Over Ukraine Killings,"The United States was expected to announce tough new sanctions on Russia Wednesday, including a ban on new investments, a day after Ukraine's president showed the UN Security Council harrowing images of violence and accused Moscow of widespread atrocities. The sanctions come after an outcry over the discovery of dozens of bodies in civilian clothing in areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn around Ukraine's capital, including the town of Bucha.  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky likened Russia's actions to Nazi atrocities in an impassioned speech by videolink to the 15-member UN Security Council on Tuesday.  ""They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children,"" Zelensky said.  He demanded stronger action from Western powers and called for Russia's exclusion from the Council, where it holds veto power. Later in his nightly address, a frustrated Zelensky said Russia was blocking the UN from carrying out ""the functions for which it was created.""  ""The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn't,"" he said.  In an interview with the BBC, the U.S. ambassador to the UN admitted that ""no one can question [Zelensky's] frustration with the Council and how the Council operates."". But she insisted that the Council was holding Russia to account, and that Moscow was isolated within it.  The killings in Bucha and elsewhere have galvanized support for Ukraine, with Washington announcing another $100 million in military aid, and produced new momentum for additional sanctions on Moscow. ""We had already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, and the information from Bucha appears to show further evidence of war crimes,"" a U.S. source familiar with the planned measures said.  On Wednesday, Washington, in coordination with the G7 and the European Union, is expected to announce measures including a ban on all new investments in Russia.   ""You can expect... that they will target Russian government officials, their family members, Russian-owned financial institutions, also state-owned enterprises,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told a briefing on Tuesday.  A new sanctions package being prepared by Europe, meanwhile, is set to include oil and coal, France's foreign minister said at EU talks in Luxembourg. And Britain said it has so far frozen some $350 billion in assets from President Vladimir Putin's ""war chest."" As part of the push to isolate Moscow, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Slovenia expelled dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of being intelligence operatives on Tuesday, following similar moves in France and Germany — a total of some 180 expulsions in 48 hours. The Kremlin called it a ""short-sighted move"" that would complicate efforts to negotiate an end to the hostilities. Putin also warned of ""reprisals"" for recent European measures targeting Russian gas giant Gazprom — and said Moscow would ""monitor"" its food exports to ""hostile"" nations, raising the specter of shortages and price spikes. The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings, claiming the images emerging from Bucha and other sites are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out. At the Security Council meeting, Moscow's ambassador rejected Zelensky's claims, saying the ""ungrounded accusations... are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses."" But satellite photos taken while Bucha was still under Moscow's control show what appear to be bodies lying in streets where the dead were later found by Ukrainian forces and seen by journalists.  And multiple Bucha residents told AFP they had seen Russian soldiers killing civilians. ""Right in front of my eyes, they fired on a man who was going to get food at the supermarket,"" said 43-year-old Olena, who declined to give her family name. During a grim cleanup, the remains of partially burned bodies in black bags were lifted into a van, with officials telling journalists ""dozens of bodies"" remained in apartments and in nearby woods. Western nations have given short shrift to Russia's denials. ""What we've seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit. It's a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who will visit Kyiv this week, has offered the bloc's assistance in documenting proof of war crimes. Ukrainian authorities have warned that others areas may have suffered even worse fates than Bucha.  Scenes of devastation have met those venturing into areas from which Russian forces have withdrawn.  In the northern city of Chernigiv, which was besieged from the early days of the invasion, a charred children's hospital, full of bullet and shrapnel holes, served as a shelter. In the dank basement, children painted on walls — tiny handprints, a smeared rainbow, a fluttering Ukrainian flag. ""Cluster bombs were flying, we have traces of these bombs,"" said 51-year-old Olena Makoviy. ""The injured were brought to the children's hospital, both adults and children."" City officials estimate around 350 civilians have been killed in Chernigiv, with fellow residents digging mass graves to bury them.  ""It was very scary here from the first days of the war,"" said Makoviy. ""They brought guys, handsome, young, but no longer alive."" None The Russian withdrawal from areas around Kyiv and the north is part of a shift of focus toward Ukraine's southeast, in a bid to create a land bridge between occupied Crimea and Moscow-backed separatist statelets in Donbas. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance expects a Russian push in ""coming weeks"" to try to seize the entire Donbas.  In the village of Krasnopillia there, Ukrainian forces were preparing to counter that push.  ""We know the Russians are reinforcing and are getting ready to attack,"" a senior Ukrainian officer on the ground told AFP. ""We are ready... we've planned some surprises for them along the way."" Civilians have been asked to evacuate west and on Tuesday a line of cars stretching 3 kilometers was waiting to pass a checkpoint, while thousands of other residents boarded trains to leave. And violence has continued elsewhere, with Ukraine's prosecutor general saying Tuesday that bombing around Kyiv had killed 12 people. Peace talks between the sides have so far gone nowhere, though Moscow says it is ""ready"" to continue. Ukraine has proposed an agreement where other countries would guarantee its security in return for Kyiv accepting a neutral and non-nuclear status, not joining NATO and refusing to host foreign military bases. The proposal would also see Russia accept Kyiv's admission to the European Union."
Russian Cinema in Turmoil as Hollywood Pulls Out,"After years spent translating Hollywood films, Russian Mila Grekova was suddenly thrown out of work after Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. Five Hollywood giants — Disney, Warner Bros, Universal, Sony Pictures and Paramount — have all stopped releasing new films there, leaving Russian cinemas bereft of the latest blockbusters. But it has not made Grekova turn against President Vladimir Putin. ""It's the West that I hate today and not Putin,"" the 56-year-old said. ""Bollywood may replace Hollywood in Russia, but it's too late for me to learn Hindi,"" she said, referring to India's refusal to condemn Moscow or join in with sanctions. Russia's film industry has been thrown into turmoil by the fighting in Ukraine just as it was beginning to recover from the pandemic. And like in many sectors hit by sanctions, the film industry is turning away from the West, looking inward to its own movies or east to Asia. Russians are avid cinema-goers with the highest number of admission in Europe, 145.7 million last year, according to the European Audiovisual Observatory.  Many flock to see Hollywood films, which are often dubbed instead of being shown with subtitles.  None Before Hollywood's withdrawal, Russian company Mosfilm-Master was dubbing around 10 foreign films a month, mostly from English. ""Now we have lost two thirds"" of business, the company's director Yevgeny Belin told AFP in its high-tech dubbing studio in Moscow. ""During the pandemic, we had films but no cinemas open. Today, we have our cinemas but no films,"" he said. Russia's National Association of Cinema Owners said last month that cinemas risk losing up to 80% of their revenue. Looking to adapt, Mosfilm-Master is on the hunt for translators from Korean and Mandarin, even though Belin said he ""doubts that Asian films work for Russians"" because of cultural differences.  ""Westerners are closer to us,"" said the 70-year-old, who has spent three decades in dubbing.  Olga Zinyakova, the president of Karo, one of Russia's leading cinema chains, said she is confident the industry can rebuild. ""The situation is extremely difficult but not catastrophic,"" the 37-year-old said. ""Since the arrival of Hollywood in post-Soviet Russia 30 years ago, we have gone through a lot of crises: political, economic and the pandemic,"" she said, surrounded by empty seats in Moscow's Oktyabr cinema, home to Europe's largest screening room with 1,500 places. Since the conflict began on Feb. 24, the number of tickets sold in Karo's 35 cinemas has fallen by 70%, Zinyakova said. The Russian government has promised major financial support and tax breaks to film production and cinemas, as it looks to replace Hollywood films with more homegrown fare. ""Russians will explore themselves more deeply,"" said Zinyakova, pointing to the success of Russian films from the 1990s like the cult movie ""Brat"" (""Brother"") which is screening again in several Moscow cinemas. Zinyakova is also preparing to include more Asian and Latin American films among upcoming releases.  ""And when Hollywood comes back, the Russian market and viewers will no longer be the same,"" she said. Pavel Doreuli, a 44-year-old sound designer who works on around 15 Russian films a year, said it was no surprise that Hollywood has pulled out of Russia.  ""World cinema has been hostage to big politics for years,"" he said, saying major film festivals like Cannes and Berlin were no longer about art, but about promoting ""certain values"". Still, Doreuli said it would be a shame for Russia to be cut off from world cinema, pointing to the exclusion of official Russian delegations from this year's Cannes film festival. ""If they are excluded from international festivals, Russians will give up on arthouse cinema that offers a different vision of the world, which is so precious today,"" he said."
West Readies New Sanctions on Russia Over Ukraine Killings,"Western powers were readying new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday after Ukraine's president called for tougher action and accused Moscow of atrocities during the six-week war. The measures follow an international outcry over hundreds of civilians found dead in areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn around Ukraine's capital, including the town of Bucha.  In a video address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky showed harrowing images of corpses — including of children — that he said were victims of Russian atrocities. ""They cut off limbs... slashed their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children,"" he said, after earlier comparing Russia's assault to the 1937 Nazi bombing of the town of Guernica. The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings, claiming the images emerging from Bucha and other sites are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out. Zelensky called for Russia's exclusion from the UN Security Council, where it is one of five members with veto power, saying it was blocking the UN from carrying out ""the functions for which it was created."" On Wednesday, Pope Francis — who has repeatedly called for peace, while not naming Russia or President Vladimir Putin — also deplored the ""powerlessness of international organizations."" At his weekly audience at the Vatican, the 85-year-old pontiff kissed a flag he said had come from ""that martyred city Bucha,"" condemning ""ever more horrendous cruelties"" in Ukraine. The UN General Assembly announced later it would vote Thursday on suspending Russia from the body's Human Rights Council, after moves by the U.S. and Britain to have it excluded. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 11 million displaced as refugees or within Ukraine since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. Western powers have already pummelled Russia with debilitating economic sanctions, which forced Moscow Wednesday to make foreign debt payments on dollar-denominated bonds in rubles. But the killings in Bucha and elsewhere have galvanized support for Kyiv, with Washington announcing another $100 million in military aid, and produced new momentum for additional sanctions on Moscow. Washington, in coordination with the G7 and the European Union, is expected on Wednesday to announce measures including a ban on all new investments in Russia.   ""You can expect... that they will target Russian government officials, their family members, Russian-owned financial institutions, also state-owned enterprises,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told a briefing on Tuesday.  The EU meanwhile was poised to implement a fifth round of sanctions cutting off Russian coal imports -- and European Council chief Charles Michel said that ""sooner or later,"" it must also impose oil and gas sanctions. Condemning ""war crimes"" in Russia, he said: ""There must be, and there will be, severe consequences for all those responsible."" But addressing the Irish parliament Wednesday, Zelensky condemned the ""indecisiveness"" on the part of EU nations, which are dependent on Russian energy. ""We still need to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine with new sources of funding,"" Zelensky added, calling also for the total exclusion of Russian banks from Western finance. In Britain, which says it has so far frozen some $350 billion in assets from Putin's ""war chest,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said what happened in Bucha ""doesn't look far short of genocide to me."" He said the international community ""will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin's regime."" In other moves to isolate Moscow, a string of EU countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain have expelled more than 200 Russian diplomats and staff between them this week. The Kremlin called the mass expulsions a ""short-sighted move"" that would complicate efforts to negotiate an end to the hostilities. Putin also warned of ""reprisals"" for recent European measures targeting Russian gas giant Gazprom — and said Moscow would ""monitor"" its food exports to ""hostile"" nations, raising the specter of shortages and price spikes. At the Security Council meeting, Moscow's ambassador rejected Zelensky's claims, saying the ""ungrounded accusations... are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses."" But satellite photos taken while Bucha was still under Moscow's control show what appear to be bodies lying in streets where the dead were later found by Ukrainian forces and seen by journalists.  And multiple Bucha residents told AFP they had seen Russian soldiers killing civilians. ""Right in front of my eyes, they fired on a man who was going to get food at the supermarket,"" said 43-year-old Olena, who declined to give her family name. During a grim cleanup, the remains of partially burned bodies in black bags were lifted into a van, with officials telling journalists ""dozens of bodies"" remained in apartments and in nearby woods.

Civilians have been asked to evacuate west and on Tuesday a line of cars stretching three kilometers was waiting to pass a checkpoint, while thousands of other residents boarded trains to leave. Russian strikes on Wednesday killed at least two people and wounded five others near a humanitarian distribution point in the east Donetsk region, the regional governor said. Meanwhile shells and rockets were landing at regular intervals in the industrial city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukrainian forces on the eastern frontline. Peace talks between the sides have so far gone nowhere, though Moscow says it is ""ready"" to continue. Ukraine has proposed an agreement where other countries would guarantee its security in return for Kyiv accepting a neutral and non-nuclear status, not joining NATO and refusing to host foreign military bases. The proposal would also see Russia accept Kyiv joining the European Union."
